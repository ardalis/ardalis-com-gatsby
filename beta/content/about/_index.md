## What I Do

I'm passionate about helping developers write better software. Software is everywhere, and it can really change the world for the better for its users. Unfortunately, all too often software becomes unmaintainable over time. I have a great deal of experience with keeping that from happening, and with dealing with legacy systems that have suffered this fate.

### Training & Education

I help development teams master modern software practices through:

- **Corporate training workshops** on Clean Architecture, SOLID principles, and .NET
- **Online courses** on Pluralsight covering architecture, refactoring, and design patterns
- **Conference speaking** at events worldwide
- **YouTube content** for ongoing learning

### Consulting & Mentoring

I work with teams to:

- **Accelerate project delivery** through architectural guidance
- **Improve code quality** with proven patterns and practices
- **Reduce technical debt** through strategic refactoring
- **Establish development best practices** for long-term success

### Core Expertise Areas

- **Clean Architecture** and Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- **SOLID Principles** and Object-Oriented Design
- **ASP.NET Core** and modern .NET development
- **Software Architecture** patterns and practices
- **Code Quality** and refactoring techniques
- **Team Leadership** and mentoring

## Why Work With Me?

> "Our team could spend many hours with other developers figuring out a problem or best practice, or we could set up a meeting with Steve."

> "Steve is able to quickly understand the problems we are trying to solve and then works with us to solve the problems."

I believe in **practical solutions** over theoretical concepts. My approach focuses on:

- Real-world applicability of design patterns and principles
- Incremental improvement rather than complete rewrites
- Knowledge transfer to build long-term team capabilities
- Proven techniques that scale with your organization

## Books & Publications

I'm the author of several technical books and have contributed to the official ASP.NET documentation. My writing focuses on making complex architectural concepts accessible to developers at all levels.

## Speaking & Community

I regularly speak at developer conferences and user groups, sharing insights on:

- Clean Architecture implementation
- SOLID principles in practice
- Microservices vs. modular monoliths
- Domain-Driven Design techniques
- Modern .NET development practices

## Get Started

Whether you need help with a specific project, want to improve your team's skills, or are looking for ongoing mentoring, I'm here to help you become a better developer.
