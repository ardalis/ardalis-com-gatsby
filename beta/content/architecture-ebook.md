I've written an eBook for Microsoft titled [Architecting Modern Web Applications with ASP.NET Core and Microsoft Azure](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/thank-you/aspnet-ebook). It's part of the [.NET Application Architecture guidance portal](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/architecture) on Microsoft.com.

## Access Options

**ðŸ“– Read Online**: [Microsoft .NET Architecture Portal](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/architecture)

## About This Book The book also includes a sample reference online store application ([eShopOnWeb](https://github.com/NimblePros/eShopOnWeb)) that demonstrates (in a very simple app) some of the principles and patterns described.

This book intentionally focuses on a monolithic architecture, meaning that the application is deployed as a single unit. There's [an accompanying ebook by Cesar de la Torre](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/thank-you/microservices-architecture-ebook) that covers building a microservices and containers-based architecture that uses the same online store sample, but built in a different way (eShopOnContainers). Most customers will find the single-deployment approach to be less expensive to create, deploy, and maintain, but the microservices approach is certainly worthwhile for certain high-end applications.
