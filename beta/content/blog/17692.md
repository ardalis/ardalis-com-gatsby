[RockyH](http://rockyh.net/)has a great little [video walkthrough called Assembly Hijacking](http://www.rockyh.net/AssemblyHijacking/AssemblyHijacking.html)showing how a bad guy can use a combination of SQL Injection and lack of strong named assemblies to do bad things to an e-commerce website. Definitely worth watching and remembering.
