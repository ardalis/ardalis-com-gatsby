This article, [When Blogging Gets Risky](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6949377), talks about some of the negative effects blogging can have on employees when their employers read everything they say on their blogs. It also makes a good point that companies should have blogging policies, and talks about some success stories for companies who have embraced blogging ([Sun](http://www,sun.com/), [Google](https://www.google.com/)), though notably absent is [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/) despite their hundreds of bloggers and the fact that it was published on [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/) (or perhaps because they didn't want to be tooting their own horn).
