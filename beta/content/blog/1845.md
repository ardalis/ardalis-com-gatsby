I've now gotten a fair bit further along, and have created my first custom widget for the [UIMapper](http://uimapper.net/). There is a sweet filepicker control (which also handles file uploading) called [AWS FilePicker](http://www.awsystems.biz/products/filepicker). It's also FREE! Anyway, I now have a FilePickerWidget working with the Wilson UIMapper. It was actually pretty straightforward to get working. Given that the AWS control is free, maybe [Paul](http://wilsondotnet.com/) would bundle this widget with a later release or premium edition of UIMapper…
