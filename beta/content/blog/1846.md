There was a good thread on the [SqlAdvice.com Stored Procedure](http://sqladvice.com/category.aspx?c=32) list today which included several solutions for this problem. The latest and ostensibly best one so far can be found in [the sql archives here](http://sqladvice.com/message.aspx?MessageID=143773). That list, and the other lists on SqlAdvice, are great places to ask questions about anything database and SQL related.
