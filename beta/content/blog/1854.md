In addition to these [speaking engagements](http://aspadvice.com/blogs/ssmith/archive/2005/03/23/1852.aspx), I've also got the following plans for June 2005:

[Tech Ed](http://www.microsoft.com/events/teched2005/default.mspx)\
5-10 June 2005\
Orlando, FL\
I won't be speaking but I'll likely be one of their volunteer experts, doing stuff with MVPs, ASPInsiders, INETA, CodeWise/CodeZone, etc. I'm looking forward to seeing many of my.NET community friends there, most of whom I haven't seen in over a year.

[Visual Studio 2005 DevCon](https://www.chrysalisevents.com/vs2005devcon)16 June 2005\
Detroit, MI\
I'm~~tentatively~~speaking on what's new with ASP.NET in 2.0. I don't have a URL for this event yet.\
***Update: Now have a URL and a definite speaking topic.***
