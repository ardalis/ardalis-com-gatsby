If you're in the greater Detroit area, and aren't doing anything more interesting this Thursday (June 16th), I strongly recommend attending the [Visual Studio 2005 DevCon](http://www.chrysalisevents.com/vs2005devcon) being put on by Microsoft and including a bunch of local subject matter experts. I'll be giving the first session in the ASP.NET track, What's New in ASP.NET 2.0. All attendees will receive a copy of Visual Studio Team System Beta 2 on DVD, the latest SQL Server 2005 CTP, and a Visual Studio/MSDN Transition Guide. [Register today](http://www.chrysalisevents.com/vs2005devcon)!
