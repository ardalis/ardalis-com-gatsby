[Cindy Brucato](http://brucato.us/blogs/cindy) has begun an interesting lunchtime learning program at her workplace, which she's dubbed [The Brown Bag Initiative (or Brown Bagging It) €" BBI](http://brucato.us/BLOGS/cindy/archive/2005/06/21/552.aspx). Yesterday she updated this with [a list of good webcasts to watch](http://brucato.us/BLOGS/cindy/archive/2005/06/22/553.aspx) during these events, and since most of them looked interesting to me, I'm blogging it so I can find the links later.
