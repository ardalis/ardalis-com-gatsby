Ok, so I just finished a 3-day Ascend class on VSTS and one thing I'm disappointed by is the fact that I most likely won't be able to use VSTS to replace [SourceGear Vault](http://sourcegear.com/vault/index.html) immediately, since I collaborate with developers over the Internet all over the world, and VSTS does a lot of stuff via AD or direct network access.

The only solution for over-the-internet work is a VPN, which at the moment I don't have, though I guess I should probably start looking into what's involved with that.

However, this sounds a lot like the issues involved with Visual SourceSafe that led to [SourceGear's](http://sourcegear.com/) first big product, [SourceOffSite](http://sourcegear.com/sos/index.html). Wouldn't it be cool if some enterprising company (like, maybe, [SourceGear](http://sourcegear.com/)) were to offer an add-on to VSTS that allowed it to work over the Internet without requiring any VPN? I know I'd be very interested in that.
