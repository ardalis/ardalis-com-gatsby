My DE, [Drew Robbins](http://geekswithblogs.net/drewby), talked to be about the [Regional Director](http://msdn.microsoft.com/isv/rd) [program](http://msdn.microsoft.com/isv/rd) back in May, and asked if I would be interested. One thing led to another, and a few weeks ago I submitted a stack of legal documents back to Microsoft which eventually led to the great and wonderful accomplishment of… my name appearing [on this](http://www.microsoftregionaldirectors.com/Public/rdFindNC.aspx) [web page](http://www.microsoftregionaldirectors.com/Public/rdFindNC.aspx)!

I'm honored to have been invited and to be in such excellent company, and I'm looking forward to the opportunity to work with Drew and Microsoft in some new ways.
