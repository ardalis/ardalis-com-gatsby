I'm a bit late, but I just discovered [Nikhil's ASP.NET Development Helper Browser](http://www.nikhilk.net/)

[Plugin](http://www.nikhilk.net/) (with screenshots). Downloading it and will have to play with

it next chance I get. From the screenshots it looks very cool, especially

the ability to view the current page's ViewState (both encoded, and decoded with

value pairs). Check it out.
