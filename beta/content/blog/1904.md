[ScottGu](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu) announced the [availability](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2005/08/01/421275.aspx)

[of the ASP.NET 2.0 Provider Toolkit](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2005/08/01/421275.aspx) a couple of days ago €" I just saw

it. The toolkit provides a full source code implementation of how to build

your own providers for Membership, Role Management, Health Monitoring, and

Personalization features. Definitely going to grab that

immediately €¦
