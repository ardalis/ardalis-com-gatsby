I got a new laptop stand from my buddy [Scott Cate](http://scottcate.mykb.com/) last week which is making me much happier. I used to have to hunch over all day so I could look directly at my laptop screen, and I didn't want to spend $100+ for a manufacturer laptop stand (and I don't need a port replicator). So Scott's cheap but effective (and light and portable!) solution seems to be working quite well for me. Here's my setup:
