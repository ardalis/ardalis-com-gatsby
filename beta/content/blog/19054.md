I love TechSmith – they have some extremely cool tools including my favorite, Camtasia, which is the de facto standard for creating screencasts and coding/presentation videos (like the [Atlas videos](http://aspalliance.com/videos) now on ASPAlliance.com). I finally got a chance to meet up with TechSmith Chief Evangelist Betsy Weber, whom I've worked with via email for years, and she posted a picture of us on [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/betsyweber/166865761/in/set-72157594162706947):

Incidentally, Betsy and TechSmith are great when it comes to community support. If you're a user group leader or presenter, you should check out their offers of free stuff for your group/audience, [here](http://www.techsmith.com/presenters).
