I guess there aren't very many drive-in movie theaters in the country (or world) any more, so this is almost newsworthy. We saw Madagascar and Sky High. Madagascar was entertaining but not as good as I was expecting from the previews. The penguins were great, though.

We almost lost our local drive-in, [Midway Twin Drive-In](http://www.lakemetro.com/funflick/midway2.html), a few years ago when a storm blew the main screen down. Fortunately, they rebuilt it. I like to try and make it to the drive in movies at least once each year; it's a fun summer time tradition.
