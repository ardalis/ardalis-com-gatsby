I found this post by Rushi Desai on [Invalidating cached result sets using SQL Server Query Notification](http://blogs.msdn.com/rushidesai/archive/2005/03/18/398928.aspx). It's from March so it's a bit out of date, but it has some working ASP.NET sample code (well, working in Beta 2, I presume, but pretty close for RTM).
