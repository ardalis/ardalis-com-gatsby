[ScottGu](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu)write about the lack of

web project files in VS2005:

[VS](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2005/08/21/423201.aspx)

[2005 Web Project System: What is it and why did we do it?](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2005/08/21/423201.aspx)

There have been some threads lately on other blogs about whether this helps

or hurts enterprise developers, with the main counter-point from Scott being

that most of the pain points being reported around ASP.NET 2.0 Beta 2 are in

fact Beta2 issues, not ASP.NET 2.0 issues, and will be corrected at

RTM.
