Flew in last night. I was supposed to stay at the New Otani but they

oversold their rooms, so at 1am local time they finally found me (and about 8

other PDC-goers) rooms back at the airport (45 min away). They paid for

everything, as well they should, but I'm rather short on sleep now as a

result. So far PDC has been pretty cool — I'm about to blog about the

keynote and some other cool news, then it's back to talking to people for

me.
