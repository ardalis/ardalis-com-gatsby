I was stuck with a problem a few weeks ago where my DataFormatString on a BoundField in a GridView was not being applied. I had a chance to look at the code again today and found [this very helpful post by Raj Kaimal](http://weblogs.asp.net/rajbk/archive/2005/10/31/429090.aspx) with the fix this morning. The short answer is that you need to set HtmlEncode= "false" in order for the DataFormatString to work. The HtmlEncoding by default is designed to defeat cross site scripting attacks, but unfortunately the way it is implemented results in DataFormatString being ignored.
