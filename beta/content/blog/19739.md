I recored a quick video demonstrating the effects of a very short duration cache on a page that's hitting the database more than 1/second ([microcaching](http://aspalliance.com/251)). This is one of my favorite demos when I give my caching presentations – I believe I first saw Rob Howard do pretty much the same demo quite a few years ago so credit goes to him for the idea. You'll find the video in the [ASPAlliance Videos](http://aspalliance.com/videos) section, [here](http://aspalliance.com/928).

It was my first Camtasia video in years and I'm using a pretty cheap microphone, so I apologize in advance for the audio quality. All in all it went reasonably well, though. I'll try to record a few of my other caching demos as videos this week, too, so that when they fail during a talk I can just pull up the video and play it so the audience can at least see that yes, it does work, at least sometimes…
