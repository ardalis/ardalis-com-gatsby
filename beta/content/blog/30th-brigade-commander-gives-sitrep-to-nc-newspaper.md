In [this article](https://www.fayettevillenc.com/story.php?Template=military&Story=6593016), General Hickman describes the current situation in his (my) brigade's area of operations here in Iraq. I pretty much agree with everything he has to say, too, so if you're wondering how things are going over here, have a read.
