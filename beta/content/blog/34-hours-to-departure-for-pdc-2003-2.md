My flight leaves at 0535 Monday morning from Akron-Canton, getting me into Los Angeles at 0951. I figure I'll probably make it to the hotel by 11am and the convention center by noon, which means I'll miss the keynotes.

I'm looking forward to meeting a ton of folks at PDC this year. I think I've got more meetings set up than sessions to attend, so I guess I'd better order the DVD with the slides. I can't wait to be able to write some articles about Whidbey on [AspAlliance.com](https://aspalliance.com/). I got the latest issue of [aspNetPRO](https://aspnetpro.com/), in which I wrote an article for this month's issue (being released at PDC and devoted to Whidbey), and there is a lot of great content in it ([Paul Wilson](https://weblogs.asp.net/pwilson), [G. Andrew Duthie](https://weblogs.asp.net/gad), [Stephen Walther](https://aspworkshops.com/default.aspx#aboutsteve) also contribute, and there is an interview with [Scott Guthrie](https://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu) that should definitely not be missed.) So anyway, reading that has me itching to publish some v2 stuff on [AspAlliance.com](https://aspalliance.com/), so look for some good stuff next week.

Stop by Wednesday in the exhibit hall from 2pm-2:45pm. [Rob Howard](https://weblogs.asp.net/rhoward) and I will be signing copies of our book, the [ASP.NET Developer's Cookbook](https://aspalliance.com/cookbook/default.aspx). You can sign up for the 2.0 cookbook, which will be full of all-new recipes for Whidbey, and receive a discount when it's published.

I also got an €˜I'm Blogging This ' T-Shirt for PDC which reminds me quite a bit of the McDonald's €˜I'm Lovin ' It ' campaign that they're running now. I'll be sure to wear the shirt at least one day this week.

I'm in town until Thursday night €" my flight is at 2255 (10:55pm), which gets me home at 0950 Friday. Humorously, I have an appointment Friday morning at 1030 that I'm supposed to be awake for €" we'll see how that goes.
