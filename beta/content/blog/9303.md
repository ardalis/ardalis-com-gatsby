[Lance Frizzell](http://iraq.billhobbs.com/) has a nice story about how the 278th from TN are helping local Iraqi children medically and educationally. Expanded as a news story on [BillHobbs.com](http://billhobbs.com/hobbsonline/005761.html).

Also linked is this story of how [Iraqi children hold the key to a peaceful future](http://www.estripes.com/article.asp?section=104&article=27186&archive=true), which I think is certainly true.
