Yesterday (Leap Day), the [Ajax Control Toolkit team released an update to the toolkit](http://www.codeplex.com/AtlasControlToolkit/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=11121). This release comes in two flavors, one for the 3.5 framework (which has AJAX baked into ASP.NET 3.5) and one for the AJAX 1.0 release that is an add-on to ASP.NET. As always you can run through the live demos of the controls [here](http://www.asp.net/ajax/ajaxcontroltoolkit/samples). This release does not add any new controls, but does include a number of bug fixes and improvements, including a bunch of user-submitted patches ([learn how you can submit you own patches](http://www.codeplex.com/AtlasControlToolkit/Wiki/View.aspx?title=PatchUtility)).

My favorite controls in the Ajax Control Toolkit remain the AutoComplete, the CollapsiblePanel, and the TextBoxWatermark. I use this a lot in my applications. I would probably use more of the FilteredTextBox and MaskedEdit and ValidatorCallout controls if I weren't such a fan of PeterBlum's [data entry controls](http://peterblum.com/DES/Home.aspx), which have a great deal more features than the (free) Ajax Control Toolkit controls have at this point.
