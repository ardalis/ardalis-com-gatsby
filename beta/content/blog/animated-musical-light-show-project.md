Brian Peek of [ASPSOFT](http://www.aspsoft.com/) has [an article showing how to create an animated light show to your favorite holiday music on MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/coding4fun/events/holidays/article.aspx?articleid=1230660). It includes a video which you should really check out, and instructions for creating your own with all the hardware and software notes you'll need. Very cool.
