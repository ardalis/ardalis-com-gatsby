I may have gone a bit overboard this year... I've scheduled myself for 5 developer conferences in 4 weeks during October 2025! If you're interested in learning about **Clean Architecture**, **SOLID principles**, **microservices**, **modular monoliths**, and other software architecture best practices, here's where you can find me speaking across three countries and online.

Whether you're a .NET developer, software architect, or just passionate about writing better code, these sessions will cover practical techniques you can apply immediately to improve your applications.
