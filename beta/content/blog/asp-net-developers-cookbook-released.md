My new book, the [ASP.NET Developer's Cookbook](http://aspalliance.com/cookbook), is now available. I just checked [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0672325241/aspalliancecom) and it's still just accepting pre-orders, but I know it's done because I have a copy in my hands! This book was written as a combined effort between myself, [Rob Howard of the ASP.NET Team](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/rhoward), and about 20 columnists from [ASPAlliance.com](http://aspalliance.com/). It contains over 200 task-oriented recipes aimed at solving common problems faced by experienced ASP.NET developers in their day-to-day activities. Some of the recipes are pretty basic for completeness' sake, but this is not a beginner's book. It is designed to be a quick reference on your desk, and I hope that many of you will find it useful.

For more information and (soon) sample chapters, check out the book's website at [http://aspalliance.com/cookbook/](http://aspalliance.com/cookbook).
