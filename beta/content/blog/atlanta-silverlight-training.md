Shawn Wildermuth is teaching a class on Silverlight 1.0 and 1.1 in Atlanta through Dunn Training. The three day [Silverlight Workshop](http://www.dunntraining.com/SilverlightTraining.htm) is being offered July 16-18, August 13-15, and September 17-19. It looks like it will be a good class, based on the outline provided on the [course web site](http://www.dunntraining.com/SilverlightTraining.htm).
