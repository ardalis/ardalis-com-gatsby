Another quick tip related to [the use of regions](https://ardalis.com/prevent-resharper-from-adding-regions) in your C# code – you can turn off the default behavior of wrapping interface implementations in regions via the options dialog. Simply go to Tools –> Options –> Text Editor –> C# –> Advanced as shown in the screenshot below, and uncheck the "Surround generated code with #region" checkbox.
