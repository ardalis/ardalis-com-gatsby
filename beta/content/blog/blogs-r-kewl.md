I just thought I'd write something quick to tell Scott Watermasysk that he has a pretty cool thing going here with these blogs. Having thus buttered him up, I thought I'd also rant a bit about the fact that even though I tell the login to remember me, it doesn't, and that there is thus no way for me to find the link to the Admin section for my blog except to remember it and type in the URL. When can we expect these trivial problems to be fixed, Scott, hmmmm?
