I just ordered this book on the recommendation of a couple of MVC people:

[Working Effectively with Legacy Code (Robert C. Martin Series)](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0131177052/aspalliancecom-20)

Note that I don't actually have the book yet, so I can't tell you how I like it. But I will. Some day.
