In a follow-up to my [caching best practices article](http://msdn.microsoft.com/asp.net/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnaspp/html/aspnet-cachingtechniquesbestpract.asp), this one shows how to encapsulate the best practices into a helper class.

This article builds upon the ASP.NET Caching: Techniques and Best Practices article.
