Tuesday night I gave a presentation on caching in ASP.NET (with a bit of async performance tips thrown in at the end) to the [Arizona.NET User Group](http://azgroups.com/) in Phoenix, Arizona. A lot of the demos were similar to ones I've given before, including in my recent [DNRTV Show on Caching](http://aspadvice.com/blogs/ssmith/archive/2007/09/30/Caching-in-ASP.NET-Show-on-dnrTV.aspx). I've posted the samples from Tuesday night's talk [here](http://aspalliance.info/samples/cachingphoenixaz.zip), which include the async demo I did as well as an updated version that uses a templating approach for loading up the user controls. I expect to have a full blown articles and/or video on that topic soon.
