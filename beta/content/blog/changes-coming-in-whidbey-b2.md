In case you've been in Iraq or something and haven't already seen this, here's a post from [Shanku](http://weblogs.asp.net/ShankuN)about upcoming changes to ASP.NET coming in Beta 2 (mostly features that won't make the cut).

Somehow, despite my being in Iraq at the moment, this blog still gets way more readers than my current one at [ArmySteve.com](http://armysteve.com/). I guess that's a good thing, since when I get home next year I'll still have a few readers here to come back to.
