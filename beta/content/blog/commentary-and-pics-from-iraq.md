I found [Robert Alt's blog](http://noleftturns.ashbrook.org/author.asp?author=Robert+Alt) and [these pictures](http://noleftturns.ashbrook.org//iraqphotos.asp) he took while in Iraq. His accounts seem to provide a more accurate depiction of life here than the CNN doom-and-gloom snippets we see every day.

I'll try to take and post some pictures at some point, but for now it's discouraged where I'm located.
