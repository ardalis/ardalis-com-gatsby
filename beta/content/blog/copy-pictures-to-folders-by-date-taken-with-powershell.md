For about the millionth time, I was downloading the photos from my digital camera and organizing them into folders by date… by hand. I've tried a few different tools to do this in the past and have always ended up going back to a manual process for one reason or another. So this time I grew fed up (again) with the inanity of the process and decided I'd use PowerShell to accomplish the task, as it seems made for the job.

Of course I searched first for others who had done this – it's hardly a problem unique to me. I pretty quickly found [someone who not only had gotten it to work but had some pretty nice links to help for those new to PowerShell](https://blogs.msdn.com/hans_vb/archive/2009/01/10/organizing-my-pictures.aspx). Hans of course also linked to the original author, [Kim, and his post on organizing photos into folders by EXIF date taken](http://blogcastrepository.com/blogs/kim_oppalfenss_systems_management_ideas/archive/2007/12/02/organize-your-digital-photos-into-folders-using-powershell-and-exif-data.aspx). A couple of other useful links:

* [Download and Install PowerShell](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/management/powershell/download.mspx)
* [Learn How To Run Scripts](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/scriptcenter/topics/winpsh/manual/run.mspx) (no it doesn't just work out of the box, but almost)
 * If you grab my file and just type OrgPhotos.ps1 into your PS prompt and it doesn't work, this link will probably tell you why.

Here's a link to my working script:

* [OrgPhotos.ps1](http://stevesmithblog.s3.amazonaws.com/OrgPhotos.ps1)

The only hitch I ran into was that it's been so long since I've done anything with PowerShell, I forgot what the extension for it was. I thought maybe it was psl not ps1 (and the font used on the original post didn't distinguish between the two). P-S-ell sounds more like PowerShell than P-S-one but at any rate if you try to run a.psl file from PowerShell, you'll simply get an error like:

**Program 'foo.psl' failed to execute: No application is associated with the specified file for this operation.**

Easy fix – rename it to foo.ps1. (P-S-one)

Here's my final version of the script. I also made the paths use YYYY-MM-DD as these sort properly chronologically when windows sorts the folders by filename.
