I finally gave in and got a [Twitter](http://twitter.com/) account and have basically used it primarily to whine about cancelled or delayed flights and let people know where I am at [MIX](http://visitmix.com/) this week. I'm not sure whether I'll stick with it but it does seem worthwhile at least for following a large group of friends at a conference. If you're interested in my inane 140 character messages you can follow me [here](http://twitter.com/ardalis).
