As we approach the long-awaited RTM (or RTW – Release to Web) of ASP.NET AJAX (formerly "Atlas"), here's a brief history of the project:

June 2005 – Development on what would become"Atlas" begins. Most of the ASP.NET team is focused on delivering ASP.NET 2.0 and VS 2005, however, so the initial team is pretty small.

October 2005 – First Atlas Community Tech Preview (CTP) is released.

November 2005 – VS2005 and ASP.NET 2.0 ship. More Microsoft team resources available for"Atlas" work.

December 2005 – The UpdatePanel, probably the most important control in ASP.NET AJAX apart from the ScriptManager, debuts in a CTP.

March 2006 –"Go Live" License made available for"Atlas" – many sites begin using the still-CTP bits for live applications.

July 2006 – The last public CTP is made available.

October 2006 – The first beta.

November 2006 – Beta 2.

December 2006 – Release Candidate

**January 2007 – 1.0 Release** (hopefully!)

As you can see, it's been about 18 months since the project began. It's gone through a number of pretty major changes in that time, and even with its final release it will include a Futures CTP what will allow it to continue to evolve much faster than the ASP.NET point release schedule would allow for. I have several applications that are awaiting the official release (and subsequent support on [web hosts](http://orcsweb.com/)) to go live with the 1.0 feature set, and like many other ASP.NET developers, I'm very eager and excited that the 1.0 release is almost here.
