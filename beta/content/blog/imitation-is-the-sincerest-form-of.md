My [SOLID Principles of OOP and ASP.NET MVC](/asp-net-mvc-and-solid-programming-principles-june-2009) talk from this year's TechEd is seeing some new life this week in Vancouver, Canada. [Daniel Flippance is giving a presentation based on my session's powerpoint and code](http://www.danielflippance.com/blog/09-09-15/SOLID_Principles.aspx). Good luck, Daniel, and thanks for letting me know. Let me know how it goes and if you have any suggestions for making the presentation better.
