## What is"Managing Up"?

Managing up, at its core, is the strategy of working proactively with your superiors to achieve mutual goals. It's about understanding your manager's expectations, aligning them with your objectives, and ensuring that both of you work cohesively towards shared milestones. For developers, it translates to more than just meeting sprint goals; it's about showcasing your value and helping your manager succeed in their role too.

## Examples of Managing Up

1. **Transparent Communication:** Imagine your manager has tasked you with implementing a new feature that you believe might introduce potential bugs. Instead of silently implementing it, you could approach them with your concerns, maybe even suggesting a more efficient alternative.
2. **Initiative:** You've identified some [technical debt](https://deviq.com/terms/technical-debt) that's slowing down the team. Instead of waiting for an annual review to discuss it, you proactively set up a meeting with your manager to present the problem and potential solutions.
3. **Feedback Loop:** After the completion of a project, you ask your manager for feedback, demonstrating your eagerness to grow and align with the team's expectations.

## Tips and Tricks for Effective Managing Up

Master these tips and tricks to become a pro at managing up.

1. **Understand Their Goals:** Know what drives your manager. What are their goals? What is their boss expecting from them? Do they have certain Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) they need to hit? By understanding these, you can align your contributions to directly impact their success. I like to sum this one up as, **"Whatever role you're in, your job is basically to make your boss look good."** If you have opportunities to interact with your"skip level" (manager's manager or above), you can apply this same principle to them as well. And be sure to mention something your manager has done well recently when you do so.
2. **Regular Check-ins:** Don't wait for scheduled reviews. Set up short, regular check-ins to discuss progress, concerns, and get their input. This helps in building a relationship of trust and transparency. Don't make your manager ask you for status reports - send a weekly email summarizing what you accomplished. This is a great way to keep them informed and also to remind them of your contributions, and you may find the emails to be very useful come review time, too.
3. **Be Solution-Oriented:** It's one thing to identify a problem and another to provide a solution. Always try to approach your manager with potential solutions when discussing challenges, even if they're solutions that are outside your ability to implement. This demonstrates your initiative and problem-solving skills.
4. **Seek Feedback:** Show your manager that you're eager to grow and improve. Regularly ask for feedback and act on it. This helps in building a culture of continuous improvement and growth. If possible, ask for one, specific thing you can improve, and then work on that. If you ask for too much feedback, you may not be able to act on it all, and you may overwhelm your manager.
5. **Manage Expectations:** Clearly communicate about timelines, potential roadblocks, and needs. This helps in preventing any last-minute surprises. **The best way to exceed expectations is to set them appropriately in the first place.**

## Why Managers Benefit Too

When developers embrace the practice of managing up, it's not just the individual who reaps the rewards. Managers benefit immensely. They receive transparent communication, proactive solutions, and a team member genuinely invested in shared success. This not only helps in achieving team goals but also aids in fostering a positive work environment where both parties thrive.
