I recently heard about a set of controls that is being made freely available via CodePlex with the goal of improving the usability and consistency of medical software applications. The [Microsoft Health Common User Interface (CUI)](http://www.mscui.net/Default.aspx) includes a suite of rich controls and guidance for building user interfaces that follow a standard approach to user interface design. The [CodePlex Project for MSCUI](http://www.codeplex.com/mscui) includes the controls library. The controls are freely available and open source, so they provide a great value beyond just health care applications, since they include commonly required items like a [DateInputBox](http://www.mscui.net/Components/DateInputBox.aspx) and a [TimeInputBox](http://www.mscui.net/Components/TimeInputBox.aspx). The controls are available as both WebForms and WinForms controls, too. [View the samples here](http://www.mscui.net/ControlsAndSamples.aspx).
