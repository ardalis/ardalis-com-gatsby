[PDC 2009](http://www.microsoftpdc.com/) will once again be held in Los Angeles, but rather than October the event will take place in mid-November (17-19 November 2009). The web site hasn't been completely updated yet, but you can see the new logo and dates and sign up to learn more about [sponsors](http://www.microsoftpdc.com/sponsors) and "Partner Opportunities."

[Lake Quincy Media](http://lakequincy.com/) will once again be a Silver Media Sponsor for the event, which tends to coincide nicely with our focus on Microsoft Developers. I believe we'll be sponsoring the exhibitor lounge once more, where the hard-working booth staff all are able to grab a bit to eat or catch a bit of rest after manning the expo hall. \[shameless plug] Look for us at the show if you're interested in learning how we can help reach Microsoft developers via our [extensive network of community and Microsoft-owned publisher sites](http://lakequincy.com/Advertisers/AdNetwork.aspx). \[/gulp sselemahs]

Oh, and since the hotels near the show usually sell out months in advance, you might want to grab your room now if you're planning on going to the show.
