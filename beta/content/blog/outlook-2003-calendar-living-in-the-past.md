There's probably a way to fix this – I'm hoping someone will tell me.

I have Outlook 2003. I have the calendar set up to default to Month view. However, it seems to always want to show me a lot of stuff in the past. It might just be that it is showing me the whole current month, but halfway through the month I really don't care about the first half of the month, I'm much more concerned with the first half of the **next** month. Is there any setting that will have it show "this week and the next 4 weeks" for the Month view? Or some kind of custom view that it will remember?
