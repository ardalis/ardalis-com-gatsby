I was lucky enough to attend a few [Birds of a Feather](http://ardalis.com/forums/bof) sessions at [PDC05](http://msdn.microsoft.com/events/pdc), including one hosted by [Julia Lerman](http://www.thedatafarm.com/blog) on [Going Solo](http://ardalis.com/forums/BOF/goingsolo). At many of these, the time goes by very quickly and many of the attendees have additional questions for the host or for one another that must go unanswered. Further communication is usually limited to a few hastily exchanged business cards, but the group itself disintegrates within moments of the end of the session.

Well, in answer to this, [AspAdvice](http://ardalis.com/) has set up post-event forums for **ALL** of the PDC05 Birds of a Feather sessions. Couldn't make it to PDC, or to a BOF you were interested in? Check out [these forums](http://ardalis.com/forums/bof), ask a question for the group, see a bit of what you missed. If you did attend the BOF in person, you might summarize what you thought of it and post it to that BOF's forum for others to benefit from. The forums are there to help get good information out, so please, use them.
