If *for some reason* you find yourself wanting to switch from [Moq](https://nuget.org/packages/Moq) to another test double framework like [NSubstitute](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NSubstitute), here's how to do it.

## Working with Moq

I've used Moq for many years and am comfortable with it. I also appreciate that it has a short name, which makes it easier to type, say, etc. than longer names with 4+ syllable. I've heard of NSubstitute but never used it until literally today, when I decided to try it out.

I found porting from Moq to NSubstitute to be trivial and actually I like the fact that NSubstitute uses the same types as the ones it's substituting.

Here's an example of a method for which I would use a test double to test some behavior:

```csharp
public class DeleteContributorService: IDeleteContributorService
{
 private readonly IRepository<Contributor> _repository;
 private readonly IMediator _mediator;
 private readonly ILogger<DeleteContributorService> _logger;

 public DeleteContributorService(IRepository<Contributor> repository,
 IMediator mediator,
 ILogger<DeleteContributorService> logger)
 {
 _repository = repository;
 _mediator = mediator;
 _logger = logger;
 }

 public async Task<Result> DeleteContributor(int contributorId)
 {
 _logger.LogInformation("Deleting Contributor {contributorId}", contributorId);
 var aggregateToDelete = await _repository.GetByIdAsync(contributorId);
 if (aggregateToDelete == null) return Result.NotFound();

 await _repository.DeleteAsync(aggregateToDelete);
 var domainEvent = new ContributorDeletedEvent(contributorId);
 await _mediator.Publish(domainEvent);
 return Result.Success();
 }
}
```

This class has three dependencies: a repository, a mediator, and a logger. I want to test that when the repository returns null, the method returns a NotFound result. I also want to test that when the repository returns a valid aggregate, the method returns a Success result. Finally, I want to test that when the method returns a Success result, it publishes a domain event.

Here's how I would do that with Moq (showing just the first test):

```csharp
public class DeleteContributorService_DeleteContributor
{
 private readonly Mock<IRepository<Contributor>> _mockRepo = new Mock<IRepository<Contributor>>();
 private readonly Mock<IMediator> _mockMediator = new Mock<IMediator>();
 private readonly Mock<ILogger<DeleteContributorService>> _mockLogger = new Mock<ILogger<DeleteContributorService>>();
 private readonly DeleteContributorService _service;

 public DeleteContributorService_DeleteContributor()
 {
 _service = new DeleteContributorService(_mockRepo.Object, _mockMediator.Object, _mockLogger.Object);
 }

 [Fact]
 public async Task ReturnsNotFoundGivenCantFindContributor()
 {
 var result = await _service.DeleteContributor(0);

 Assert.Equal(Ardalis.Result.ResultStatus.NotFound, result.Status);
 }
}
```

This works fine, but notice that all of the types in question or `Mock<T>` and that injecting them into the SUT requires using their `.Object` property. I've been doing this for at least a decade using Moq so I'm pretty used to it, but when compared to NSubstitute it's more verbose and requires more typing.

## The NSubstitute Version

```csharp
public class DeleteContributorService_DeleteContributor
{
 private readonly IRepository<Contributor> _repository = Substitute.For<IRepository<Contributor>>();
 private readonly IMediator _mediator = Substitute.For<IMediator>();
 private readonly ILogger<DeleteContributorService> _logger = Substitute.For<ILogger<DeleteContributorService>>();

 private readonly DeleteContributorService _service;

 public DeleteContributorService_DeleteContributor()
 {
 _service = new DeleteContributorService(_repository, _mediator, _logger);
 }

 [Fact]
 public async Task ReturnsNotFoundGivenCantFindContributor()
 {
 var result = await _service.DeleteContributor(0);

 Assert.Equal(Ardalis.Result.ResultStatus.NotFound, result.Status);
 }
}
```

This test also passes - the behavior is the same. Notice that the only difference is that I'm using `Substitute.For<T>()` instead of `Mock<T>()`. I'm also not using the `.Object` property to get the actual object to inject into the SUT. I'm injecting the test doubles directly. This is a small difference, but it's one I like. I also like that the test doubles are the same types as the ones they're substituting. This makes it easier to remember what they are and what they do.

## What About Setup?

I didn't show any setup in the above examples, but it's pretty similar. Here's how I would set up a test double to return a value in Moq:

```csharp
_mockRepo.Setup(r => r.GetByIdAsync(It.IsAny<int>()))
.ReturnsAsync(new Contributor());
```

Here's how I would do the same thing in NSubstitute:

```csharp
_repository.GetByIdAsync(Arg.Any<int>())
.Returns(new Contributor());
```

Note once more that the latter is less verbose and doesn't require using a lambda, which many developers, especially new developers, find confusing at first (I've taught testing and TDD for many years).

## Summary and Resources

If you already have tests that use Moq and you're happy sticking with it, that's great. If you're looking for a new test double framework, NSubstitute is a good choice. It's easy to use and has a lot of features. It's also easy to port from Moq to NSubstitute, as I've shown here.
