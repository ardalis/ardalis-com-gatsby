Recently I did a webcast on Principles of Software Design in which I very quickly covered several important principles, as well as a few patterns and practices, that lead to better software quality. If you're interested, you can [view a recording of the webcast](http://www.pluralsight-training.net/microsoft/olt/webcasts/listing.aspx)(click the wmv link beside the 16 Sep 2010 webcast), or [download the slides and demos](http://stevesmithblog.s3.amazonaws.com/PrinciplesOfSoftwareDesign.zip).
