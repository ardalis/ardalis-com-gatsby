My [recent DotNetRocks interview with Carl Franklin and Mark Dunn is live now](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=368). The three of us discuss our experiences as small business owners. I also did a show with Craig over at [Polymorphic Podcast](http://polymorphicpodcast.com/) last week that should be live next week on caching and performance with ASP.NET. I did a similar [ caching show last year on dnrTV](http://www.dnrtv.com/default.aspx?showNum=85) that runs through some nice demos and has sample code with it, but the show with Craig for PP adds a few more things (though without the screencast and demo code – audio only). I appreciate all feedback and hope you enjoy the shows!
