[Joel](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/) writes about his experience shipping many, many DVDs: [How to Ship Anything](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/HowToShipAnything.html). An interesting read, especially since this is the time of year that ASPAlliance sends out a few hundred items to friends and contributors for the holidays. Thankfully, we're not in the business of shipping anything year-round, so we shouldn't need all of Joel's toys any time too soon, but it's a good read just the same. And yes, customs forms are a total pain when you have many to do…
