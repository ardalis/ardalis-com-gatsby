[SimpleCMS](http://codeplex.com/simplecms)is a (very) simple content management system I developed with [Brendan](http://aspadvice.com/blogs/name) for [ASPAlliance.com](http://aspalliance.com/) and which is now available from CodePlex (with source). [Steve Schofield](http://weblogs.asp.net/steveschofield) recently put it to work in IIS7, a scenario we have not yet tested ourselves, and found that it worked more-or-less without difficulties. He posted his [steps for setting up SimpleCMS using IIS7 and the Integrated Pipeline](http://weblogs.asp.net/steveschofield/archive/2008/01/03/iis7-post-60-migrate-simplecms-to-iis-7-0-using-integrated-pipeline.aspx) if anybody is interested.
