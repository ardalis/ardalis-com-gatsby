I recently published an article on [Alternatives to the Singleton Design Pattern on AspAlliance.com](http://aspalliance.com/2028_Alternatives_to_the_Singleton_Design_Pattern). If you're a fan of the Singleton pattern, I would encourage you to have a read and feel free to comment (here or there) if you agree or disagree with my position. You can also learn more about the Singleton in the [Patterns Library at Pluralsight](http://www.pluralsight-training.net/microsoft/olt/Course/Toc.aspx?n=patterns-library). Finally, if you haven't read it, I definitely recommend checking out [Jon Skeet's coverage of the Singleton](http://csharpindepth.com/Articles/General/Singleton.aspx), as it provides several alternative implementations and demonstrates several weaknesses of the naïve implementation of the pattern.
