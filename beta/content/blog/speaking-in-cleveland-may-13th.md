I'll be speaking at the [Cleveland.NET SIG](http://www.bennettadelson.com/technicalresources/sig.aspx) tomorrow night. The topic is Black Belt Performance Tips for ASP.NET, which will be a dry run for a session by that same name I'll be giving next month at [Tech:Ed Developers in Orlando](http://www.microsoft.com/events/teched2008/developer/default.mspx). Some of the primary areas covered will be advanced caching techniques and asynchronous programming techniques (for ASP.NET). The user group meets at the Microsoft office in Independence, Ohio from 5:45pm to 7:30pm and usually is pretty crowded.
