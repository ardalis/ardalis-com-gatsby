Tomorrow I'm going to give a presentation on Caching Best Practices in ASP.NET 2.0 at the [Greenville Spartanburg Enterprise Developer Guild](http://www.gspdevelopers.org/Home/tabid/53/Default.aspx). If you're in the area, please come by. I'll put the slides and samples up on the [ASPAlliance Resource Directory](http://index.aspalliance.com/)'s [Presentations File Gallery](http://index.aspalliance.com/FileGallery/Presentations/default.aspx)after the presentation.

**Update**: [Slides and demos](http://index.aspalliance.com/FileGallery/Presentations/Details/169_.NETCachingBestPracticesMarch2006.aspx)available now.
