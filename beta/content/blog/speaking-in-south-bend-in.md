I'll be speaking at the [Michiana Area.NET Users Group (MADNUG)](http://www.madnug.net/) this Tuesday, February 17th, about Whidbey (ASP.NET / VS.NET v2). The presentation will essentially be a 'whirlwind tour' of many of the most exciting new features in Whidbey, with the general format being slide, demo, slide, demo. If you haven't seen Whidbey yet, or had a chance to use the tech preview (released at PDC to attendees), this should be a very exciting look into what's coming. Thanks to Eric Landes for organizing the event and inviting me. Hope to see you there!
