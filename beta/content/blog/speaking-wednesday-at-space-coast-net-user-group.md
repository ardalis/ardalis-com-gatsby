The [Space Coast Dot Net User Group](http://www.scdnug.org/) is hosting me, and [INETA](http://ineta.org/) is sponsoring the talk. If you're in the area, please stop by to join in the event.

[I gave this same talk last week to the Kent State ACM chapter](/speaking-at-kent-state-university-acm-chapter) and it went pretty well. I plan to tweak the demos a bit before this presentation. Ultimately, I'm giving this same talk at TechEd in LA in about a month, so these events are providing sneak previews of what's to come at TechEd.
