I'm a fan of checklists – they're an intermediate step before automating a process to ensure it's done correctly and consistently. You'll find [a number of different checklists on this site](https://ardalis.com/tags/checklist). This one is about streaming, specifically for [my twitch.tv/ardalis account](https://www.twitch.tv/ardalis). I've been meaning to blog about this forever, but it's just been sitting in my OneNote for the longest time while other things have been a priority. But today, at long last, it's going to make it to my blog!

* Run any IDE updates for Visual Studio, VS Code, etc. (but don't do this within 30 minutes or so of your start time)
* Run Streamlabels (if you're using it)
* Silence phone.
* Make sure you have water on hand.
* Take a bio break.
* Adjust fonts to 16-20 in text editors. Zoom browser windows to 125%
* Set show title and tags in Twitch dashboard
* Add "Starting Soon" scene about a minute ahead (if using one)
* Tweet that you're starting
* Add"On Air" Red Circle to Twitter Name: 🔴
* If playing music ([Music to Code By](http://mtcb.pwop.com/) for instance) start and set volume to 1-5%
* Launch Chatty (or other chat monitor) in separate monitor
* Verify you're set up to use the correct microphone and sound is making it to your stream!
* Verify your camera (and background) are good to go, too.
* Disable notifications and turn off chat/IM clients (or move to another monitor).
* Close unneeded windows and applications.
* If you want, [set chat to"Followers Only"](https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2017/01/26/your-chat-has-been-upgraded-with-followers-only-mode-e2031707ab4c/) via"/followers 1m" (requires users to have been following you for 1 minute before they can post to your chat). /followersoff to remove.
