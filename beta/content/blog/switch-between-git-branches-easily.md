I recently ran across [a great tip from Kevin Griffin](https://twitter.com/1kevgriff/status/885154568232947713) for how to quickly switch from your current git branch to your previous one:

Instead of typing out the full name of the branch when using git checkout, you can simply specify – (minus or dash) to refer to the previous branch.

Now think about how you're going to put all those saved keystrokes to good use.
