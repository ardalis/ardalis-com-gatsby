I'm going to be doing most of my blogging over at [http://aspadvice.com/blogs/](http://aspadvice.com/blogs) from now (well, actually a couple of weeks ago) on. If you're subscribed to this, you should subscribe to <http://aspadvice.com/blogs/ssmith/rss.aspx> instead/as well.

Thanks!\
Steve

Update: Updated URLs. Also, get $5 for signing up for a new PayPal-like service [I blogged about here](http://aspadvice.com/blogs/ssmith/archive/2006/02/02/TextPayMe_is_The_Next_PayPal.aspx)(until end of Feb 06).
