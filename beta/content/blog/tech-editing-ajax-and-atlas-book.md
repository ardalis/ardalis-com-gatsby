I'm almost done with tech editing an upcoming book from Wiley by [Wally](http://weblogs.asp.net/wallym), [Paul](http://weblogs.asp.net/pglavich), [Craig](http://polymorphicpodcast.com/), and [Scott](http://scottcate.mykb.com/), on Beginning AJAX and Atlas. It's been a very educational experience but I'm glad it's wrapping up (and hopefully the book will be on shelves before this whole AJAX fad wears off).

**Update**: Oops, forgot an author. Sorry Craig, I was zoning out.
