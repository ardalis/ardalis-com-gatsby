Eric Gunnerson at Microsoft has published an article on [Unit Testing and Test Driven Development](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dncscol/html/csharp03202003.asp) (he calls it Test First Development). It does a good job of introdcuing the concept of TDD and showing how to use [NUnit](http://sourceforge.net/projects/nunit) to perform unit testing of a class before and during its construction. Another good resource I've found for TDD is the [TDD Yahoo Group](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/testdrivendevelopment). I'm hoping to write a few articles on the use of NUnit for data access component testing as soon as I'm finished with the redesign of [ASPAlliance.com's](http://aspalliance.com/) article management system (which was to have been done last week).
