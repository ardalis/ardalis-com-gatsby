Recently we moved from one end of our [office building in Hudson, Ohio](http://distinctivespacesllc.com/) to the other, and while we wait for some space to open up and get renovated, a few of us are working out of a conference room with a 10' or so long heavy duty table in the middle of it. So we decided to deck it out with as many computers and hi-res flat screens as possible. Sitting on one side, there are 3 keyboards, 3 mice, and 5 monitors (driving 3 computers with a combined 18GB of RAM), which makes for a pretty good pair programming experience (the laptops on the ends are for email/IM).

Once we move to more permanent quarters, it'll be tough to duplicate this much hardware in such a compact space, but for now it's rather impressive (though having some more desktop space for notepad usage would be nice).
