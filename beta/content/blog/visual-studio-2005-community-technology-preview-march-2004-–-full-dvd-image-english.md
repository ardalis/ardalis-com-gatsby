If you're an MSDN Universal subscriber, you can now download VS 2005 from <https://msdn.one.microsoft.com/Subscriber/1033/Default.asp>. I believe VSLive attendees are getting the DVDs this week as well. I've got quite a few hours to go on my download, but once I have it and install it, I'll be sure to blog about what's new.
