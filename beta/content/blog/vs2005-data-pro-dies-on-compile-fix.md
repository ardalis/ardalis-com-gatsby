I had an issue with VS2005 For DB Pros (the Data Dude SKU) where every time I would build my solution (or that project), VS2005 would simply die. This was on Vista. After looking for the answer, I contacted [Gert Drapers](http://blogs.msdn.com/gertd) who informed me of the fix — [install the RTM of SQL 2005 SP2](http://blogs.msdn.com/gertd/archive/2007/02/19/sql-server-2005-sp2.aspx) (or just the XMO redist) and the problem's solved.

Thanks, Gert – I hope this helps some others who had a CTP of SP2 installed.
