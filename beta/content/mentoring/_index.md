Need a little help? Accelerate your project (or your career) with a bit of mentoring. Here are areas in which other teams and individuals have found my experience (or that of my team at [NimblePros](https://nimblepros.com)) helpful:

## Software Architecture

Design of a new system or redesign of an existing one. Focus on the trade-offs most important to your stakeholders. Every architecture decision involves trade-offs - if you don't know what they are, you're making them by default. Learn when to embrace microservices, when to use a modular monolith, and when to leverage clean architecture, vertical slide architecture, or something else entirely to suit your needs!

## Coding Practices

This is a huge umbrella of topics, but I'm experienced with the following:

Design Patterns, Refactoring, Testing and Testability, Separation of Concerns, Loose Coupling, SOLID Principles, identifying and eliminating code smells, and more.

## Domain-Driven Design

Event storming, modeling the domain, keeping contexts bounded, identifying aggregates and entities, implementing repositories and specifications, upgrading primitives to value objects, wiring up domain events.

## Lean and Kanban

Helping visualize work using a variety of tools (both high and low tech), maximizing flow, measuring and improving cycle time.

Whether youâ€™re a team or an individual, I'm available to remotely work with you to help you build software you can take pride in (note that these rates are most afforable by teams - see devBetter below for a more affordable individual option).
