## Get a new developer tip in your inbox every... occasionally!

Ok I haven't been great about keeping these weekly, but I do occasionally send out newsletters with updates on my latest content or speaking schedule.

# Weekly Dev Tips – The Podcast (on hiatus)

Listen to my Weekly Dev Tips podcast for more software development tips, provided in short audio form. You can expect some overlap in terms of topics, but unless you've been getting the newsletter since day one, you probably won't find too much repetition between the two formats. Available online, iTunes, etc.
