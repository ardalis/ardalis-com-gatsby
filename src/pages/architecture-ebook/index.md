# Architecture eBook

[![Architecture-eBook-Cover](/img/Architecture-eBook-Cover-242x300.png)](/img/Architecture-eBook-Cover.png) I’ve written an eBook for Microsoft titled [Architecting Modern Web Applications with ASP.NET Core and Microsoft Azure](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/thank-you/aspnet-ebook). It’s part of the [.NET Application Architecture guidance portal](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/architecture) on Microsoft.com. The book also includes a sample reference online store application that demonstrates (in a very simple app) some of the principles and patterns described. This book intentionally focuses on a monolithic architecture, meaning that the application is deployed as a single unit. There’s [an accompanying ebook by Cesar de la Torre](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/thank-you/microservices-architecture-ebook) that covers building a microservices and containers-based architecture that uses the same online store sample, but built in a different way. Most customers will find the single-deployment approach to be less expensive to create, deploy, and maintain, but the microservices approach is certainly worthwhile for certain high-end applications.

I’m working with organizations every day helping them plan and implement their migration to .NET Core and/or the cloud. Some are looking toward microservices and containers, as well. I’ve seen firsthand many pitfalls and false starts. [Contact me](https://ardalis.com/contact-us) if your team or organization is planning such moves and you’d like to avoid going down the wrong path. A few hours with me might save your team a few weeks or months.
