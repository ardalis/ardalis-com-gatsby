I’ve recently been converted to the “kill all unnecessary

tags used for layout” camp. I’ve been working for the last couple of months on usability and structural improvements to [AspAlliance.com](http://aspalliance.com/) and have reduced the total size of each page significantly. The site **flies** now compared to a few months ago. However, it still uses a lot of TABLE tags for the main body, since I’ve thus far only had time to redo the header using DIV tags and CSS.

That said, I’m also working on a few applications that require some menu systems for the administration, and I’ve been looking at the easiest way to create a tabbed navigation (without 3rd party components, to keep things simple and if necessary redistributable without coupling). I’m amazed at the power of the UL / LI elements when coupled with CSS, and how widely these constructs are now supported. In particular, I [one site with a large selection of examples of how easily this can be done](http://css.maxdesign.com.au/listamatic). Check it out — I’m pretty sure .Text’s admin page uses one of these horizontal techniques for its tabs.

**Update:** After browsing through my CommunityServer install, I see they use [SilverOrange Labs CSS Tabs](http://labs.silverorange.com/archives/2004/may/updatedsimple), which are pretty cool, too. I may go with these!
