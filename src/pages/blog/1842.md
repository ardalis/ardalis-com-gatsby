[Steven Cohn](http://weblogs.asp.net/stevencohn) has a[nice hack for supporting multiple root websites](http://weblogs.asp.net/stevencohn/articles/59782.aspx) on Windows XP Pro. You can’t do multiple simultaneous sites, but between this and the HOSTS file you can simulate any live site on your XP Pro box, which is a lot handier than having to remote into a Server install or use a virtual machine. (and of course, the reason this is an issue at all is that developing a site that resides in a domain root is a whole lot easier when you don’t have to try and switch between a dev environment that exists in a subfolder and a production environment that is in the root).
