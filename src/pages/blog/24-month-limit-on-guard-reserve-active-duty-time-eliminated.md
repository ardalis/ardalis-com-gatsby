***The day after President Bush announced his plan for a deeper U.S. military commitment in Iraq, Gen.

This is pretty much bullshit, but not unexpected. I'm very happy that I have my honorable discharge in hand now. There is essentially no distinction between Reserve and Active Component forces now in terms of deployments, since either one can be deployed indefinitely without any required time between deployments. Since the "War on Terror" is not a declared war on an enemy state, but rather an unwinnable war like the "War on Crime", there is also no hope that the current state of conflict will end in the foreseeable future.

Net effect – if you're in the reserves you might want to consider just putting your life on hold and join the active component (if possible) since the pay, advancement, and benefits are all better and you'll probably be deploying about as much either way.
