Sarah Truman, whose husband is in the 278th, sent me some links last week. One was to the [Times Free Press’s section on the 278th](http://www.timesfreepress.com/iwwl/index.html), written by a reporter that is embedded with the unit. There are a bunch of 278th ACR specific articles there. The other was a blog written by Lance Frizzell, a medical LT at FOB Cobra (which I went to a few times but never lived at), called [Lance In Iraq](http://www.iraq.billhobbs.com/). Check them out.

Sarah told me her husband was recently involved in an IED attack and suffered a close call. It sounds like he will be ok. I just wanted to write here that he’s in my thoughts and I hope his sergeant, who was hurt much worse in the incident, recovers as well.
