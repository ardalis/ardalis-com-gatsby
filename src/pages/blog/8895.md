I just installed [w.bloggar 3.01](http://wbloggar.com) and the [WMPAmplog Plug-In.](http://www.minimalverbosity.com/2003/April/29/introducing_wmpamplog.htm) Let's see how it works... I used [Daniel Bright's setup instructions](http://www.danielbright.net/misc) to get set up in about 20 seconds. If you're reading this, everything must have worked. Ah, something for the wmpamplog FAQ - it doesn't work until you exit and restart Winamp. Pretty easy one to troubleshoot, though. Also looks like I'll have to set up my own CSS file to define class "media" for the music link...
