## What’s an Ardalis?

I pronounce Ardalis ar-DAL-us, but you’re welcome to pronounce it however you like. I started using it as my online username in the 90s because shockingly any consistent variation of ‘Steve Smith’ is hard to come by. I made up the name originally for a paladin character in a table top role-playing game (GURPS). Since then it’s become my online identity/handle, and I use the name for my twitter, blog domain, and many other usernames.

## About my Blog

This is now the fifth place I’ve had a blog, if you don’t count my initial home page and articles on ASPAlliance.com, which were somewhat blog-like but preceded the term (began in 1997). Unlike my past blog moves (from the ASP.NET/blogs site to AspAdvice.com/blogs and my ArmySteve.com / ArmyAdvice.com/blogs/ArmySteve blogs, and then from there to SteveSmithBlog.com and now ardalis.com), this time I’m pulling everything into one place. You can use the archive to see some older archives if you’re into that sort of thing, including my [2004 Iraq Deployment](https://ardalis.com/category/iraq).

If you’re here, you’ve found my blog. It goes back a long ways – you can [browse the archive here](https://ardalis.com/archive).

## History

In January 2012 I moved my blog from SteveSmithBlog.com to Ardalis.com, which is shorter, more memorable, and lines up with my twitter alias.

In July 2008 I moved my blog from [AspAdvice.com/blogs/ssmith](http://aspadvice.com/blogs/ssmith) to my own domain, SteveSmithBlog.com. I’m keeping all the old content at the old blog, as well as my previous [Army blog that I kept while I was in Iraq in 2004](https://ardalis.com/category/iraq).
