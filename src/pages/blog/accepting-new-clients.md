I’ve recently left my role as Chief Technology Officer at [Falafel Software](http://falafel.com/) to focus more on what I really enjoy: mentoring teams and helping developers improve the quality of their skills and applications. Falafel is a great company and I continue to work with them, providing services to several clients, but I am now also making my services available directly (as well as working on several [online training classes](https://ardalis.com/training-classes)). I’m most interested in working with teams who are actively seeking to improve, but are having challenges doing so. In my experience, just spending a couple of hours per week, or even per month, discussing team processes and coding practices or reviewing application architecture can pay huge dividends on the project. I have almost 20 years of professional software development experience and have learned a great deal in that time about certain topics, such as:

* Improving the design of existing C# code
* Architecting scalable ASP.NET and Web API applications (including [ASP.NET Core](https://docs.asp.net/en/latest/))
* [Performance Tuning](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/web-perf)
* SOLID design principles, [Design Patterns](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/patterns-library), and [Refactoring](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/refactoring-fundamentals)
* [Domain-Driven Design](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/domain-driven-design-fundamentals)
* Software Application [Assessments](http://services-ardalis-com.myshopify.com/collections/assessments/products/application-assessment)
* Software Development [AntiPatterns](https://ardalis.com/principles-patterns-and-practices-of-mediocre-programming)

If you think you and your team would benefit from my services, please[contact me](https://ardalis.com/contact) or[purchase a block of mentoring hours from my new online store](http://services-ardalis-com.myshopify.com/collections/mentoring). I have limited availability and am looking for the right clients to work with.
