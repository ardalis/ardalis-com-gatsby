The [AJAX Control Toolkit](http://www.codeplex.com/AtlasControlToolkit) just released a new version for September 2007. You can get version 10920 now from CodePlex. This release is meant to improve the stability and quality of the controls and includes a bunch of fixes both at the general and control-specific level. There are no new controls in this release. You can view live demos of the toolkit controls on the [AJAX Control Toolkit Sample Site](http://asp.net/ajax/ajaxcontroltoolkit/samples).
