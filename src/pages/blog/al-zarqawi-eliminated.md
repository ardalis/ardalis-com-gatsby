Great news for Iraq – [Abu Musab al-Zarqawi was killed in a raid north of Baghda d](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13195017) recently. His own organization has confirmed the news (of course vowing to continue killing innocent Iraqis, etc. etc.).

More from MSNBC:

> *Al-Zarqawi and seven aides, including spiritual adviser Sheik Abdul Rahman, were killed Wednesday evening in a remote area 30 miles northeast of Baghdad in the volatile province of Diyala, just east of the provincial capital of Baqouba, officials said.*

Baqouba is not far from where I was stationed, and Diyala was the province we covered while we were there. I wonder how far from the little town of Balad Ruz this would be, since that would be just east of Baqouba and was one of our trouble spots when I was at FOB Caldwell. Of course, it says they were in a “remote area” and there are certainly plenty of those in the region. In any case, this is **very good news**, especially since the attack did not come with any civilian casualties.
