Richard Grimes, a very recognized author and speaker on .NET topics, addresses what he considers as [some missteps in the development of .NET and offers words of warning about the future of the platform](http://www.ddj.com/documents/s=9211/ddj050201dnn).

I have to say that some of his predictions, while certainly not what I would like to hear, seem to be pretty feasible given the course Microsoft has taken these last few years. I also tend to agree that Microsoft has done a poor job of providing a strong reason for VB.NET to exist beyond as a means to try and make the jump to .NET for VB developers less painful. I’ve believed for years that a VB6 developer would be less confused to jump to .NET using C# than to try and remember all the differences between VB and VB.NET (which looks like VB, but isn’t), as I described in an article several years ago, [Why I Chose C#](http://authors.aspalliance.com/stevesmith/articles/ViewArticle.aspx?id=27). At any rate, this is certainly an interesting read.
