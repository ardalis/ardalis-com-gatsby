Ron McDaniel who is into [Buzz Marketing](http://buzzoodle.blogspot.com/) posted [about the TextPayMe marketing effort](http://buzzoodle.blogspot.com/2006/03/viral-marketing-effort.html) that I’m participating in. When I last checked, they’d given away 11 $300 XBox 360 systems (5 of which appear to be to the same CP from Washington). That works out to about $3300 assuming they’re paying retail, which is unlikely. Considering the amount of buzz they’ve generated through this contest, and the number of people who have signed up and referred a dozen or two of their friends (who do not get XBoxes), I’m betting their campaign has been a massive success, in terms of ROI. This, to me, is a classic example of building up buzz about a product through the use of [grassroots viral marketing](http://www.wilsonweb.com/wmt5/viral-principles.htm). I’m betting that when the current contest ends in two weeks, they’ll have given away fewer than 25 of the XBox systems, for a total marketing cost of around $7500 — not bad.

Check out the contest details and current winners list: [TextPayMe.com](https://www.textpayme.com/us/secure/index.tpm?clref=ZjBjOTRjZTctMGE1Ny00ZmM4LThkOGQtNTA3MDE1ZWMxMjE1). I expect SS from Ohio (me) to be on the site some time this week. [Sign up through my banner here](http://ardalis.com/blogs/ssmith/archive/2006/02/02/TextPayMe_is_The_Next_PayPal.aspx) and let me know you did and I’ll TextPay you $1 for your trouble (I’d offer more but I only have like $3 in my account — so, offer is limited to the first three people who contact me!).
