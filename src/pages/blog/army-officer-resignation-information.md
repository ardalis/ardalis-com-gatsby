Last Monday was my eight-year anniversary from my commission date, and I submitted my official resignation effective on that date. According to my Career Management Officer (CMO), resignations are taking several months to process, so I won’t know if mine is accepted for some time. I was able to submit the request via email but I also send hard copy as well to be sure (and I received confirmation of receipt for both methods). I thought I’d share some links here for anybody else who is interested.

You will find a nice [sample resignation letter](https://www.hrc.army.mil/site/reserve/soldierservices/guidance/resignletter.htm)on the [HRC website](https://www.hrc.army.mil/). There is also a link there with [guidance for how to go about submitting your resignation letter](https://www.hrc.army.mil/site/reserve/soldierservices/guidance/resignation.htm), depending on what your current unit affiliation is. That was pretty much all I needed. I’ll post back here if and when I get a response.

**Update:** Don’t know whom your CMO is? Email here: [opcombat.support@hrcstl.army.mil](http://ardalis.com/mailto:opcombat.support@hrcstl.army.mil) with your contact info and ask.
