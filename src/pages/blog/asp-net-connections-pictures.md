I’m at [ASP.NET Connections](http://devconnections.com/asp) in Orlando this week, promoting [DevAdvice](http://devadvice.com/) with my wife Michelle, our daughter [Ilyana](http://ilyanasmith.com/), and [David Gottlieb](http://aspadvice.com/blogs/dgottlieb), who has been doing a lot of dev work for the site. I’ve uploaded the first couple of days’ pictures to a gallery [here](http://aspadvice.com/blogs/ssmith/gallery/129.aspx).

*Update: [David Gottlieb](http://aspadvice.com/blogs/dgottlieb) has some more pictures [here](http://aspadvice.com/blogs/dgottlieb/gallery/135.aspx). I’ll be adding more to my gallery, perhaps today, as well.*
