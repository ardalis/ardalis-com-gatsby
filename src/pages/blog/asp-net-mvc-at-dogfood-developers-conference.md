I gave a presentation a couple of weeks ago at the Columbus Ohio [Microsoft Dogfood Developers conference](/speaking-at-dog-food-conference-in-columbus-ohio-november-2008). Danilo, the main organizer of the event, snapped a couple pictures of me during the talk. This was my first time presenting on ASP.NET MVC and I want to definitely thank [ScottGu](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu),[ScottHa](http://hanselman.com/),[Phil Haack](http://haacked.com/), and [Jason Gaylord](http://jasongaylord.com/) for their great presentations on this subject, from which I borrowed and added my personal spin and perspective. Jason was kind enough to let me use his simple blog application as the basis for my demos, which I extended by making it fundamentally more testable. I apologize for taking so long to get the slides and demos posted – it’s been a crazy couple of weeks (hence the lack of blogging). The files are up now:
