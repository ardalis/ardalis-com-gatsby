[Ambrose](http://dotnettemplar.net/thecatsoutoftheboxtheaspnetsandbox.aspx) posted about the [ASP.NET Sandbox](http://www.asp.net/downloads/teamprojects/default.aspx?tabid=1) yesterday (which I saw in my daily [DotNetSlackers](http://dotnetslackers.com/) new email), which prompted me to have another look at it. Read [Ambrose’s post](http://dotnettemplar.net/thecatsoutoftheboxtheaspnetsandbox.aspx) first – he gives a nice overview of what’s there.

The list includes some projects that have had big press, like Web Application Projects and Web Deployment Projects, but there are also some less-well-known projects in the works including [BLINQ](http://www.asp.net/sandbox/app_blinq.aspx?tabid=62), which [ScottGu](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu) demo’d at TechEd, and a nice [Table Profile Provider](http://www.asp.net/sandbox/samp_profiles.aspx?tabid=62) that stores user profile data in a more accessible manner than the default SqlProfileProvider. I haven’t had a chance to get either of these working myself but I’ve downloaded them both and hope to do so soon.

Another tool that looks promising to me is the [IIS Log Parser](http://www.asp.net/sandbox/app_logparser.aspx?tabid=62). I’ve downloaded this and used it in the past and it’s pretty nice – comes with full source, too. I’m not using it in my day-to-day activities yet or anything, but it’s certainly worth checking out, both as a useful app and as a nice example of how to write such an application.
