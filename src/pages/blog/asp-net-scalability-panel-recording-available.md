I was honored to be asked to participate in a panel discussing ASP.NET Scalability at TechEd 2007 a couple of weeks ago. The panel was moderated by Richard Campbell and Carl Franklin of [DotNetRocks](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/), and included Stephen Forte, Kent Alstad, Rob Howard, and myself.

The recording of that discussion is now available here:
