[](http://dnrtv.com/)I recently did a show with Carl Franklin on [ASP.NET Tips and Tricks, recorded for dnrTV.com](http://www.dnrtv.com/default.aspx?showNum=186). In it, I go through a bunch of ASP.NET tips, from the oldies but goodies like Tracing and Caching, to some new ones like optimizing the performance of your ASP.NET MVC 3 applications. The samples from the presentation are [available for download here](http://ssmith-presentations.s3.amazonaws.com/TipsTricks_dnrtv_20110218.zip).
