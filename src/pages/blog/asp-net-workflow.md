[Matt Winkler](http://blogs.msdn.com/mwinkle) posted some [very cool stuff regarding using Windows Workflow and ASP.NET](http://blogs.msdn.com/mwinkle/archive/2007/06/07/introducing-the-pageflow-sample.aspx) on his blog a few days ago. I’m just getting around to commenting on it myself. Incidentally, there are [live bits to install](http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=6923851) this time.

Naturally I haven’t had a chance to play with this myself (or much of anything else that’s come out in the last few months), but I definitely am looking forward to being able to easily use Workflow within ASP.NET applications. Hopefully this is a step in that direction.
