[ASPAlliance.com](http://aspalliance.com/) is getting a third-party site traffic audit done this week and as part of that we need a bunch of people to fill out [a really quick 10-question survey](http://www.surveys.com/s.aspx?start&project=mriip011) (really, it’s quick — it’s all checkboxes/radio buttons). If you’ve ever visited ASPAlliance and we’ve saved you some time, please give us back one minute of your time by filling out this survey. I believe it ends on November 22nd, 2005 so if you’re reading this after that date, nevermind.

Thanks! Tell a friend, too, please!
