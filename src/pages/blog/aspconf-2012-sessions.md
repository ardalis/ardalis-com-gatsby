Yesterday I presented two sessions for[aspConf 2012](http://aspconf.net/). The first was a new talk I haven’t given before on ASP.NET MVC Solution Best Practices (which I dubbed the Solution to the Solution Problem). The second one was a talk on Common ASP.NET Design Patterns, which is basically I talk I’ve given for at least a year now on Common Design Patterns, adapted slightly for ASP.NET (mainly MVC). The slides are shown below. The sample code for the MVC Solutions talk used a simple Guestbook application found[here](https://bitbucket.org/ardalis/guestbook). The samples code used in the Design Patterns talk is a fork of the MVCMusicStore application found [here](http://mvcmusicstore.codeplex.com/SourceControl/network/forks/ssmith/MvcMusicStoreRepositoryPattern).

Video of the presentations is supposed to go up on Channel 9 at some point – I’ll update this post once that happens.
