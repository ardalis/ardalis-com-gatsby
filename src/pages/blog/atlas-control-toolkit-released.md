The ASP.NET team has released the [Atlas Control Toolkit](http://atlas.asp.net/default.aspx?tabid=47&subtabid=477), which, according to their site, is:

*a collection of samples and components that makes it easier then ever to build and consume rich client-side “Atlas” controls and extenders. The toolkit provides both ready to go samples and a powerful SDK to simplify the creation and re-use of your own custom controls and extenders.*

You can read more and download the toolkit [here](http://atlas.asp.net/default.aspx?tabid=47&subtabid=477).
