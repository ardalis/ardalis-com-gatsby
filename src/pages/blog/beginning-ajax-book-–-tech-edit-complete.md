As of today I’m officially done tech editing [Beginning AJAX](http://beginningajax.com/), a book coming soon from [Wiley](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA) publishing. Amazon has a page for the book (pre-production) [here](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/047178544X/sr=1-1/qid=1147291031/ref=sr_1_1/002-2127443-1128004?%5Fencoding=UTF8). The book includes information on writing your own AJAX framework, using several existing free AJAX libraries, and working with Microsoft’s ATLAS framework. It still has a few more steps to go through before it hits the presses but you should expect to see it in the next 2-3 months, I’d guess (Amazon says August 28, 2006).
