The [transfer of power in Iraq has taken place](http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/06/28/iraq.handover/index.html), 2 days early. This is certainly good news since without a big, planned event to target, the insurgents will be less able to wreak havoc. And of course, it means they cannot keep the transfer from taking place.
