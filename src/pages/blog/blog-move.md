Please join me as I move my blog to my own URL, [SteveSmithBlog.com](http://stevesmithblog.com/). I’ll continue to post there about more or less the same things I did here, but with a bit more control over the site layout and other features. The new blog is running on Telligent’s new [Graffiti CMS](http://graffiticms.com/), which really is as easy to get up and running as they claim. The look is currently a stock template, but should be updated to be a bit more unique in the next few days. If you’re already subscribed to my feed, then you’ll continue to get updates as my RSS will be updated (though I’ve followed [ScottW’s advice and set up a CNAME for my Feedburner feeds](http://simpable.com/technology/feedburner-cname) – they now go through [http://feeds.SteveSmithBlog.com/StevenSmith](http://feeds.stevesmithblog.com/StevenSmith)).

I strongly believe in keeping URLs from breaking, and as such I will be keeping this blog’s content in place so that it continues to be a resource rather than a home of broken links. Thanks and I look forward to continuing to interact with you from my new domain/home.
