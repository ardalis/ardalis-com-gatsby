I want to update my blog reading habits and make sure there aren’t really great bloggers out there of whom I’m unaware (I’m sure there are plenty). If you’d like to help out, please [email me](/contact) with your top 3 bloggers **whom you actually read** on a regular basis. Please \*leave out\* the really big and obvious names like [ScottGu](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu),[Jeff Atwood](http://codinghorror.com/),[ScottHa](http://www.hanselman.com/blog), and [Phil Haack](http://haacked.com/). I’m already subscribed :).

You’re also welcome to comment here but I’ll have an easier time collating the results from [email](/contact).
