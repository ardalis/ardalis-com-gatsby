I just ordered this book on the recommendation of a couple of MVC people:



[![](<>)\
Working Effectively with Legacy Code (Robert C. Martin Series)](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0131177052/aspalliancecom-20)

Also testing out RoyO’s [Amazoner](http://tools.osherove.com/CoolTools/Amazoner/tabid/188/Default.aspx) tool, which appears to have worked correctly. Nice! What is Amazoner?

> Amazoner was designed to make one thing very easy if you’re a blog writer who’s also an Amazone Associate:\
> The abilty to recommend books that you like using your associate ID **EASILY**.

Note that I don’t actually have the book yet, so I can’t tell you how I like it. But I will. Some day.
