If you’re looking for information on adoption of a given platform, framework, or JavaScript library,[BuiltWith](http://builtwith.com/)has a nice site with tools and reports for that. You can view pie charts of current distribution:

or view trends over the last year (or longer with a paid account). For instance,[here’s the trend chart for ASP.NET](http://trends.builtwith.com/framework/ASP.NET).

You can also use Builtwith to inspect how a given site is built, and what kind of libraries it’s using. For instance, the weekly[ASP.NET community standup site](http://live.asp.net/),[live.asp.net, is built with](http://builtwith.com/live.asp.net):

I haven’t tried the paid features of the site, but I’ve found the free resources useful. Let me know if you’re a paying customer what you think, or if you have other similar sites you recommend.
