[Dave Sussman](http://aspadvice.com/blogs/dsussman)'s [pictures](http://blogs.ipona.com/davids/gallery/19.aspx) reminded me today how much I really wish I'd been at TechEd last week. Hopefully I'll make it next year. So far in Missouri things are proceeding very slowly with my mobilization processing - see some [pictures](http://armysteve.com/armysteve/gallery/3.aspx) and info at [ArmySteve.com](http://armysteve.com). We'll probably be here another two weeks, and later this week we'll be doing M9 and M16 qualification, so at least that's something more interesting than paperwork and medical exams. Anyway, I just wanted to say 'hi' to all my friends I normally hang with at conferences - I miss you guys.
