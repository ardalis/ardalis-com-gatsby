Those of you who subscribe to the ASPAlliance Times weekly newsletter already know that Cache Manager 1.0 was released earlier this week. You can download it from ASPAlliance.com here:

[ASP.NET Cache Manager](http://aspalliance.com/cachemanager)

This plug-in allows for the viewing and removal of any Cache API entries or output cached ASP.NET pages within an ASP.NET application. It has been compiled under 1.1 and so my hope is that it will work with any application written using ASP.NET 1.1 or 2.0. It might even work for 1.0 but no promises there. It is 100% free — enjoy and share.

If you have questions, please send them to the[Cache Manager Forum](http://http//aspadvice.com/forums/426/ShowForum.aspx).
