[](http://www.dnrtv.com/default.aspx?showNum=85 "dnrtv")I’m on [dnrTV this week with a show about Caching in ASP.NET, one of my favorite topics](http://www.dnrtv.com/default.aspx?showNum=85). I think the whole show is a bit under an hour and I go through a bunch of demos and show off some of the less-well-known features of caching, such as cache profiles, programmatic output cache invalidation, and the Substitution control that lets you have dynamic contents on a fully output-cached page. I also cover SQL Cache Invalidation and [Micro Caching](http://aspalliance.com/251), the demo that [helped win me Speaker Idol at TechEd 2007](http://techedunplugged.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!C7ECCC56AF3217A!275.entry). It was fun to record and I hope you enjoy it.

Thanks again, Carl, for inviting me on the show!
