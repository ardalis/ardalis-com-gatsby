[ArmyAdvice](http://ardalis.com/) and [Christie and Ryan](http://ardalis.com/blogs/ryanseals/default.aspx) were mentioned in [an article on deployments](http://cinchouse.com/deploy/LoveAndTechnology/ShrinkOceans.htm) by Allison of CinCHouse, an online community for military wives and women in uniform. It's a good writeup about how technology can help ease the pain of deployments, especially the fear that comes from not knowing. I'd like to add that I'm still accepting new bloggers on ArmyAdvice, so if you're reading this and you're a soldier or military wife (or husband or significant other), please [Sign Up](http://ardalis.com/user/createuser.aspx) and request a blog.
