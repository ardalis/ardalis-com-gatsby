Actually they were announced a couple of days ago, but I’ve been a bit too busy to blog. Eventually these will make it up on the [CodeMash web site](http://codemash.org/), but for now they are only listed on the events’[mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/codemash/browse_thread/thread/bcf4ff78a44b0b21). I’ve included the complete list below.

CodeMash is a great developer event held at an indoor water park each January in Sandusky, Ohio. I’ve been to the previous events, and the 2009 event will take place 7-9 January 2009 (which reminds me, I need to book my room). What makes this event unique (apart from the fact that it’s in Ohio…) is its emphasis on bringing together developers, speakers, and sponsors from a wide variety of technical and platform backgrounds. Thus, you’ll see talks on a much wider variety of topics than at many vendor-run conferences.

This will be my first time speaking at the conference and I’m looking forward to it. My topic is web application performance and scalability, which is something I’ve presented on many times in the past, but this time in the spirit of CodeMash I’ll be updating it to apply more broadly to a variety of web platforms, rather than specifically to ASP.NET.

Here’s the full list – hope to see you at CodeMash 2009!
