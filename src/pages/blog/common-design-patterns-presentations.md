This month I presented on Common Design Patterns at two regional events. I’ve given this talk a few times before, and it continues to evolve. The first one was on 4 May at[Stir Trek](http://stirtrek.com/), as a replacement talk for a cancellation. I only had about 24 hours’ notice so I didn’t spend much time updating the talk, and in fact I had to rip out a bunch of stuff that was specific to the last event I gave it at or outdated information, so visually the slides at Stir Trek weren’t what I would consider up to par. The second time I presented was last night at[MIGANG](http://migang.org/)in Michigan, and I had a chance to give the slides a bit more love and choose some appropriate imagery to support the concepts. You can view the slides from the presentation (the second one) here:

**[Common design patterns (migang 16 May 2012)](https://www.slideshare.net/ardalis/common-design-patterns-migang-16-may-2012 "Common design patterns (migang 16 May 2012)")**

The presentation’s demo code is actually a fork of the [MVC Music Store sample](http://mvcmusicstore.codeplex.com/) available on CodePlex. You can download it as a zip or via Mercurial from the [MvcMusicStoreRepositoryPattern fork here](http://mvcmusicstore.codeplex.com/SourceControl/network/forks/ssmith/MvcMusicStoreRepositoryPattern).

I did realize after talking to a couple of attendees last night that at one point I mentioned that the Design Patterns book was by Fowler. I meant Gang of Four. If you’re looking for good books on the patterns I discussed, and others, here are some good ones:

* [Design Patterns](http://amzn.to/95q9ux) – reference by Gang of Four
* [Head First Design Patterns](http://amzn.to/aA4RS6) – great learning book, highly recommended
* [Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture](http://amzn.to/Aqs5qZ) – more patterns for use in enterprise applications by Fowler
* [Domain Driven Design](http://amzn.to/JViyKD) – builds on and introduces additional patterns
* [Refactoring](http://amzn.to/JiQi73) – reference by Fowler
* [Working Effectively with Legacy Code](http://amzn.to/Ki7Zys) – in my opinion this shows better how, when, and why to refactor code than Refactoring does

And of course if you want to learn [Design Patterns](http://www.pluralsight-training.net/microsoft/olt/Course/Toc.aspx?n=patterns-library) and the [Principles of Object Oriented Design](http://www.pluralsight-training.net/microsoft/Courses/TableOfContents?courseName=principles-oo-design) that they follow, you’ll find great Pluralsight courses on these topics.
