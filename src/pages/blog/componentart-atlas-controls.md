[ComponentArt](http://componentart.com/) just released a version of their Web.UI suite, which is built for ASP.NET AJAX (aka “Atlas”). Web.UI 2006.2 for ASP.NET AJAX is “the most advanced AJAX framework available. [ComponentArt Web.UI for ASP.NET AJAX](http://atlas.componentart.com/) is the first commercial control suite designed to fully utilize this new framework.”

I haven’t had a chance to do more than view the [demos](http://atlas.componentart.com/Client-side_APIs/TreeView_Designer/Default.aspx) but they look pretty slick. The line between thin and thick clients is really blurring quite a bit now that we’re starting to get some serious client-side APIs for the web, and controls from third parties like ComponentArt do a great job of lowering the bar for how much a developer needs to know to build extremely dynamic AJAX-enabled web applications.
