If you’re looking to learn ASP.NET 5, the best place to start today is the documentation site at[docs.asp.net](https://docs.asp.net/). It’s hosted on ReadTheDocs and the source is all in GitHub ([/aspnet/docs](https://github.com/aspnet/Docs)). Since it’s all open source, you can contribute to the documentation yourself, which is a great way to learn ASP.NET 5 and help your fellow developers. I’ve created a short video that walks you through the process:
