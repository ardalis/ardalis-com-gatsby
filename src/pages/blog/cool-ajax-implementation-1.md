[ComponentArt](http://componentart.com/) has launched the a public

beta of their new charting component, [WebChart](http://www.componentart.com/charting/default.aspx).

With it, they have an [online](http://www.componentart.com/charting/gallery.aspx?control=WebChart)

[chart gallery](http://www.componentart.com/charting/gallery.aspx?control=WebChart) that takes advantage of AJAX-style code to provide a very rich

user interface. Check it out, it looks like the end results are very

pretty. Hopefully Iâ€™ll make time for a review soon.
