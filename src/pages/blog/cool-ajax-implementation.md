I’ve recently been talking with the folks at [FarPoint Technologies](http://www.fpoint.com/) and took a look at their [AJAX implementation of a web-based spreadsheet](http://www.fpoint.com/netproducts/spreadweb/tour/AJAX.aspx). It’s very cool! It’s essentially like having Excel embedded in your browser, complete with forumulas, and you can bind the whole thing to a database (and persist it back with the click of a button, too). Have a look at the [demo](http://www.fpoint.com/netproducts/spreadweb/tour/AJAX.aspx).
