One of my developers is doing some work on our Cruise Control setup and found this gem that I’d somehow missed: [CCNetConfig](http://ccnetconfig.org/). A slick little GUI for editing your ccnet.config file ([screenshots](http://ccnetconfig.org/gallery/117.aspx)). Seems to work well enough for most of the common settings – I haven’t used it enough myself yet to really fully review or evaluate it, but the project seems to be pretty active, and it’s open source so if you really need something to work, you could always add it…
