Last night I spoke at the Dayton .NET User Group on the topic of Anti-Patterns and Worst Practices. It was a pretty good-sized group, albeit rather subdued. Youâ€™ll find some of the inspiration for the talk in my [Principles, Patterns, and Practices of Mediocre Programming](http://stevesmithblog.com/blog/principles-patterns-and-practices-of-mediocre-programming) post, and others in the [97 Things Every Programmer Should Know book](http://t.co/MiFJVvq)(or online[here](http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/97_Things_Every_Programmer_Should_Know)). The [slides and demos are available for download](http://ssmith-presentations.s3.amazonaws.com/AntiPatterns-Dayton-201106.zip). Thanks to those of you who came to the meeting, and to Joe for inviting me to come down and visit.
