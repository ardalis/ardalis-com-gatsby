I’ve learned a few new acronyms this year and thought I’d start this post to let others share their favorites as well. Some of these are new to me, and some are classics that I thought were worth including even though they certainly predate 2007. Where possible I’ve included a link to find more information on the acronym/topic.

AJAX – [Asynchronous JavaScript and XML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming))

YAGNI – [You Ain’t Gonna Need It](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAGNI) – Agile development practice suggesting you build only what you need right now.

I’m sure I must be missing a bunch of other acronyms that are commonplace today for software developers – please comment with your own contributions.
