[](/img/developer-on-fire-logo_760x360.png)I recently [spoke with David Rael of the Developer on Fire podcast](http://developeronfire.com/episode-189-steve-smith-appreciating-perspectives). We talked about a lot of things in our 40 minute conversation. Here are some of the highlights:

* How I got into software development
* What excites me about building software
* My entrepreneurial experience
* My involvement in ASP.NET Core and .NET Core
* Personal stories of success and failure
* Book recommendations
* Mentoring and Parenting
* [Software Craftsmanship Calendars](https://store.deviq.com/collections/all)
