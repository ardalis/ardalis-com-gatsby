[DevExpress](http://devexpress.com/) is one of several companies I work with via [Lake Quincy Media](http://lakequincy.com/), and it seems like a very fun place to work. Recently they launched a video site to help showcase their products, and earlier this week [they made a video showing the reaction of some of their employees to the 5.4 scale earthquake in LA earlier this week](https://community.devexpress.com/blogs/thinking/archive/2008/07/29/earthquake-in-la.aspx). Check it out, and then check out some of their other videos as well.

Incidentally, [Mark Miller](http://doitwith.net/) (Miller in the video – the bald one…) also has his own blog and spoke at this year’s TechEd. He’s the brains behind CodeRush and Refactor and is a good guy to keep tabs on if you’re interested in optimizing your coding experience (though he’s not much of a blogger). He also participates in the show [Mondays](http://mondays.pwop.com/) with some very funny stuff.
