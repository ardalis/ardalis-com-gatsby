I had two talks and two panels, and both of the talks were standing room only (in the smaller theater), which was great to see. The panels were both recorded on [DotNetRocks](http://dotnetrocks.com/) and should be published later in October 2012. I also did a software craftsmanship hands-on workshop before DevReach began, which drew about 20 students who learned via hands-on exercises about TDD, dependency management, and mocking from [Phil Japikse](https://twitter.com/skimedic) and me. I’ll have a couple more of these workshops coming up later this year, which I’ll post here and/or on my [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/StevenAndrewSmith) (like to see updates as they are made there), if you’re interested (tentatively in Orlando and Las Vegas).

My Thursday session on [Principled N-Tier Design](https://www.slideshare.net/ardalis/principled-ntier-design) is here:

## Demos

The [demos from Principled N-Tier Design are on bitbucket here](https://bitbucket.org/ardalis/guestbook), and show a progression from a single solution to a domain-centric n-tier design for a simple guestbook application.
