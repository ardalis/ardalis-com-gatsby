[Euler problem 7 requires returning the 10001st prime number](http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=7). It notes that the 6th prime number is 13 in the problem description. Having already done [some work with iterators and various number generators](http://stevesmithblog.com/blog/iterators-expressions-and-linq-for-euler), including a Primes generator for previous Euler problems, the base case given in the problem can be reduced to this NUnit test:

```
<span style="color: #0000ff">public</span> <span style="color: #0000ff">void</span> SixthPrimeIs13()
{
    Assert.AreEqual(13, NumberGenerator.Primes().Take(6).Last());
}
```

Replacing the 6 with 10001 takes care of the rest. Iâ€™m really starting to dig using LINQ for this stuff.
