I finally saw [Redshift](http://redshift.ws/) this evening in Kent, where I live. They’re a local band that I’ve been listening to for a few years now but I’ve never managed to make it to a show before now. They played at the Robin Hood along with [Third Nature](http://3nature.com/) who were also very good and [Bonk](http://www.bonk826.com/), who were loud and a lot of fun (Bonk was headlining – here’s a [review of another of their Robin Hood shows](http://www.revuemagazine.com/local.html) which sounds a lot like this evening’s). Anyway, check out [Redshift’s website](http://redshift.ws/) if you’re into rock music and [download a song or two](http://music.download.com/redshift_band/3600-8735-100587714.html?tag=quickurl)and see if you like it. My favorites are Infamy and Holes of Light.
