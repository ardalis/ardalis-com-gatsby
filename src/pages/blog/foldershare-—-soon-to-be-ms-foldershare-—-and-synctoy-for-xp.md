I finally started playing with [FolderShare](https://www.foldershare.com/) earlier today, and it’s working beautifully However, my specific scenario I want is to keep two folders on Maxtor OneTouch network drives in two separate locations (home/office) in sync. Sadly, FolderShare doesn’t work on network shared folders/drives. However, I have a fix for that, I think (keep reading)…

Totally coincidentally, I read that [FolderShare is being acquired by Microsoft](https://www.foldershare.com/info/company/aboutUs.php), announced today. [Read more here](https://www.foldershare.com/info/company/aboutUs.php). This is welcome news since I suspect it means that future versions of Windows will have built in support for these kinds of file synchronizations.

But wait, I also was led by my fellow RDs to this gem, [SyncToy for Windows XP](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/info.aspx?na=40&p=1&SrcDisplayLang=en&SrcCategoryId=&SrcFamilyId=49818CF1-2287-40EA-8A6F-57BD8695F23D&u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.microsoft.com%2fdownloads%2fdetails.aspx%3fFamilyId%3dE0FC1154-C975-4814-9649-CCE41AF06EB7%26displaylang%3den). It’s only just been released recently, and while I’ve installed it I haven’t actually gotten my scenario to work just yet. But it sounds like it will do everything I want based on the [docs](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/info.aspx?na=40&p=1&SrcDisplayLang=en&SrcCategoryId=&SrcFamilyId=E0FC1154-C975-4814-9649-CCE41AF06EB7&u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.microsoft.com%2fdownloads%2fdetails.aspx%3fFamilyId%3d49818CF1-2287-40EA-8A6F-57BD8695F23D%26displaylang%3den). Between FolderShare and SyncToy I think I’m going to have a much easier time keeping my files organized between various computers, network drives, offices, etc. I can also see this being terribly useful for VPC machines as a way to keep code or other critical files in sync.
