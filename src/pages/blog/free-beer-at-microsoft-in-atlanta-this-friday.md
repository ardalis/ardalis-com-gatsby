This Friday (May 20th) come to the [Microsoft Alpharetta office](http://mappoint.msn.com/(e2xsnq45g1oi0d553edvdl45)/map.aspx?L=USA&C=34.04950%2c-84.31286&A=7.16667&P=|34.04950%2c-84.31286|1|1125+Sanctuary+Pkwy%2c+Alpharetta%2c+GA+30004|L1|) for the .NET Experience Expo! This is a free event where you can come hear all about some of the hottest topics for developers and architects. This is a huge opportunity to learn more about what Microsoft is doing for developers (and it’s a great chance to win an Xbox!) All attendees will receive a free copy of beta 2 (yep, Team Suite… the full deal), a copy of “Introducing ASP.NET 2.0”, and a swank .NET shirt. We will have a reception at the end of the day (who can beat free beer?) There will be partners attending as well in the partner pavillion (AmberPoint, Avanade, AVIcode, RDA, Internosis).
