[Doug Seven](http://www.dougseven.com/) of Microsoft is hosting a party at Howl at the Moon during TechEd on June 3rd. He has [some details on his blog](http://www.dougseven.com/blog/2008/05/geekfest-party.html) and the party will include (and require for admission) a rubber duck competition. Youâ€™ll need to pick up your duck for admission at the Teched Technical Learning Center at the Developer Tools & Languages information desk. One duck will admit two people so bring a friend!
