If you haven’t heard of Give Camps before, they’re a way for developers to give back to local charities and non-profits by providing their services over the course of a weekend. GiveCamp was an idea hatched by Chris Koenig, a Developer Evangelist for Microsoft, a few years ago and now there are many GiveCamps organized around the country, including several in the Ohio-Michigan area ([Ann Arbor GiveCamp](http://michigangivecamp.org/cms/annarbor),[Columbus GiveCamp](http://www.columbusgivecamp.org/),[Lansing GiveCamp](http://lansinggivecamp.org/),[Grand Rapids GiveCamp](http://www.grgivecamp.org/)).

In addition to developers, a GiveCamp also needs organizers, volunteers, and sponsors. If you’d like to help out or start your own GiveCamp,[there’s a nice Cookbook describing what’s involved in putting one together on the GiveCamp site](http://givecamp.org/givecamp-cookbook). A GiveCamp doesn’t have to be tied to any particular technology, and developers from a variety of backgrounds and with some diversity in skillset can join together to help their local community organizations.

GiveCamp also has a number of partners and sponsors that can help ensure the success of the project. The newest partner is [DiscountASP.NET](http://discountasp.net/), who have agreed to offer **free website hosting to all charities and non-profits that participate in a GiveCamp event**. Other partners include[Telerik](http://telerik.com/), whose Sitefinity CMS is a flexible ASP.NET-based platform that can be used as a basis for many organization’s sites, and [Telligent](http://telligent.com/), whose Graffiti CMS and Community Server products can provide an online community experience.
