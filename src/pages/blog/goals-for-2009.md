Wow, Iâ€™m really getting a late start on this post. Iâ€™d meant to come up with some goals for the year back at the start of the month, and here it is nearly February and Iâ€™m just now getting to it. So before the kids start screaming or some other emergency distracts me, hereâ€™s some quick things Iâ€™d like to achieve (personally, not business) by the end of 2009:

* **Get In Shape (obligatory)**â€“ Iâ€™m hovering just past 200 pounds at the moment. Iâ€™d like to be no more than 190 by 1/1/10. As a sub-goal, Iâ€™d like to be 1 pound lighter on the 1st of each month than I was the month prior.
* * **Biking**â€“ Last year as a family we only managed to go biking about 2 or 3 times. This year Iâ€™d like to bike 100 miles as a very attainable minimum. (Itâ€™s good to have some relatively easy goalsâ€¦) This one builds on the first one.
  * **Hiking**â€“ Akron (Summit County) has a wide variety of hiking trails and does a Fall Hiking Spree. Completing a variety of trails during the Fall yields a small shield to affix to oneâ€™s hiking stick. Itâ€™s been a year or two since the Smiths completed the spree, so Iâ€™d like to make that a goal for 2009.
* **Speak Locally**â€“ Last year I didnâ€™t make it to (much less speak at) many events in the Ohio-Michigan-Kentucky-Indiana-Pennsylvania area. This year I want to make more of an effort to speak at local events and user groups. Letâ€™s say 6 for the year (already got 1 with [CodeMash](http://codemash.org/)).
* **Take a Real Vacation**â€“ I think the last time Michelle and I took more than 2 days off for a vacation that didnâ€™t involve me speaking or other business activities was in 2004. Weâ€™ve canceled several, including one that was to have been this month. One of the tenets of XP*Energized Work*. Taking some time to recharge once in a while is a good thing, and weâ€™re way overdue.
* **Blogging**â€“ Iâ€™d like to once again shoot for 200 posts for the year, without sacrificing quality, and hopefully get up to 2000 subscribers to my RSS feed (so tell your friends ðŸ˜‰ ). Iâ€™ve been slacking so far this year and need to make blogging a more regular activity if thereâ€™s any hope of me attaining this goal.

I also have a huge backlog of pictures that need uploaded to [my Flickr account](http://flickr.com/photos/lakequincy). I hope to be 100% caught up by the 1st of next year. Thatâ€™s sort of a goal, too, but doesnâ€™t really have the same status as the others. Beyond that, I want to keep up with karate, though I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll advance to my brown belt this year, and maybe take some guitar lessons. On the business side, I need to give [ASPAlliance](http://aspalliance.com/) a major upgrade, move our office to its new location in Hudson, remodel said new location, add to our new consulting business, and start a software development best practices user group for Akron. It should be a busy year!
