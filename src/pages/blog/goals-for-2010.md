I recently wrote about [how I did with my 2009 goals](/personal-goals-and-transparency-2009), now it’s time to set a few for this year. Let’s start with two that didn’t go so well for me last year:

**1. Get In Shape**. By the end of 2010 I will be under 200 pounds. I will have achieved my Brown Belt in karate. I will have biked 100 miles. (I have a Wii Fit Plus now, so I’m sure I’ll also get better at many of the games on the system).

**2. Blogging.** This year my goal won’t be for post quantity. Rather, I want to increase my readership. By the end of 2010, I will double my readership (RSS) from about 1250 now to 2500. I will double December 2009’s 14,499 page views in December 2010 (note, 8,231 views in December 2008).

And one more:

**3. Give Blood.** I will give blood to the Red Cross four times in 2010. [You can only donate blood every 56 days in the US](http://www.givelife2.org/donor/faq.asp#3), and you also shouldn’t give blood if you’ve recently been sick or medicated, which further limits the window. The theoretical maximum one could donate within 365 days would be 7 (6.5 but if you time it right you could fit 7 times in one year). I only gave blood once in 2009 but I think four should be attainable this year if I get started soon.

I’d like to continue to be active in my local community and to focus my blogging and speaking efforts on software craftsmanship, which I think is an important concept that many developers overlook or simply don’t care about. I’ll continue to build up our [local software craftsmanship group](http://hudsonsc.com/), which is one of the only ones in the country (I only know of one other, in Chicago), and perhaps I will make it to an SC conference this year.
