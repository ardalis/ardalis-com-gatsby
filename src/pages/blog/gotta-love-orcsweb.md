Does your host do this? Today I got an IM from one of my support folks at[ORCS Web](http://orcsweb.com/), asking me about one of my dedicated servers on which I have installed SQL Express for a few small web apps. She had noticed that I’d forgotten to set up any kind of backups for these, and wanted to know if I wanted any. When I admitted that I’d forgotten to set them up,**she just took care of it for me**. How cool is that? They’re also good about letting me know when I have stuff I’m paying for but no longer using – that’s called awesome customer service and that’s how you can turn customers into fans and evangelists.
