Today is a good day. I submitted my resignation back in July 2005 when my 8 year commitment expired (I was commissioned in 1997). They told me at the time that it would take 4-6 months for the resignation to process and they were not exaggerating. The orders and certificate were received today, although technically I should have gotten them a week or two ago since they were addressed to my previous address (I moved in September). The end result is the same though: I’m **OUT**. Woohoo!

Thanks again to everyone for your support and interest. I’ll continue to post occasionally about military issues and will of course continue to keep [ArmyAdvice.org](http://ardalis.com/) available for soldiers and their loved ones to communicate with and learn from one another. I wish all of you a safe return home if deployed and a happy New Year!
