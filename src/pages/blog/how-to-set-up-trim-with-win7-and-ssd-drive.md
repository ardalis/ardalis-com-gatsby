I have an [Intel X-25M SSD](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IJA1EQ?ie=UTF8&tag=aspalliancecom&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002IJA1EQ)in my developer workstation machine (and it’s quite fast). However, I’ve heard from others that over time SSD performance can degrade due to [sub-block level fragmentation that occurs as a result of write combining](http://www.pcper.com/article.php?aid=669&type=expert&pid=7). Fortunately, newer SSD drives (like mine) support the TRIM command, but of course this only works if your system is sending the command to the drive.

**How Do I Know if Windows is Using TRIM for my SSD?**

Fortunately (and thanks to [Ken](http://www.adopenstatic.com/cs/blogs/ken)), there is a simple command you can execute to determine if windows is sending TRIM commands to your SSD drive.

Run the following command:

**fsutil behavior query disabledeletenotify**

If the result is 0, then Windows is sending TRIM commands to the device (which obviously needs to have firmware that supports TRIM for this to matter).
