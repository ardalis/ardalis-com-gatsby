  VBScript/JavaScript and ADO for its customization (e.g. anything outside the

Check it out — the [InfoPath 2003 Toolkit for VS.NET](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=7E9EBC57-E115-4CAC-9986-A712E22879BB&displaylang=en) was released a few days ago. My biggest gripe about InfoPath is that it relies on VBScript/JavaScript and ADO for its customization (e.g. anything outside the norm you want it to do). Well, according to the download page, the new toolkit:

*provides integration features and documentation that enable you to use Visual Studio .NET to create, debug, and build InfoPath projects that use Visual C# or Visual Basic .NET managed code.*

Nice! However, it also requires InfoPath 2003 Service Pack 1 or later, which you can get [here](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=D5ADC839-73F4-4299-ABA0-E88C90B25144&displaylang=en). Apparently it’s a preview of some of the fixes that will be in the Officie 2003 Service Pack 1. I’ll definitely be playing with these soon – InfoPath rules for user experience when it comes to data entry (one person, lots of data) or data collection (many people, some standard data) scenarios.
