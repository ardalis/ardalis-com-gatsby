ABC News wants to hear from IRR soldiers to find out how they feel about possibly being sent to Iraq or Afghanistan. [Contact them here.](http://abcnews.go.com/sections/wnt/US/individual_ready_reserve_mailform_040706.html)

Also, the Norwich Bulleting wrote an [opinion piece stating the obvious](http://www.norwichbulletin.com/news/stories/20040709/opinion/808144.html) about the potential for a draft in the future -- but of course not before November's election.

In other news, the [Washington Times covers a shortage in officers](http://washingtontimes.com/national/20040712-121948-5153r.htm) presently, along with some oft-repeated info on how the Army needs more soldiers, despite what senior defense officials would like to think. A [Washington Post article](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A43461-2004Jul11.html) examines the fact that more soldiers have been discharged for being homosexual than have been called up for the IRR, often for the same skillsets.

Finally, [this Michigan paper article](http://www.mlive.com/news/grpress/index.ssf?/base/news-1/108954090295260.xml) sums up my thoughts (and, to be honest, those of everybody I know) on the need for a larger active duty Army quite concisely. I could write my own opinion, but it would mirror this article.

By way of update, I'm fine and still awaiting transport to my unit. Once there, I may have some more interesting news, but until then there's little I can share aside from that I'm ok.
