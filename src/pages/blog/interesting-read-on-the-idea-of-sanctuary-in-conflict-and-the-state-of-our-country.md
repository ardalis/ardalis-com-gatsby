[BlackFive](http://www.blackfive.net/main/2005/05/sanctuary.html) pointed me to [EjectEjectEject’s essay, Sanctuary](http://www.ejectejecteject.com/) (2 parts), and after more time than I cared to spend, I finished reading it and am quite impressed. I’m going to try to make time to read some of Bill Whittle’s other essays, since I hope they’ll be of similar quality. I think he makes some excellent points about the differences between enemy soldiers in uniform and those who forswear any organization in order to achieve personal advantages by blending with civilians.
