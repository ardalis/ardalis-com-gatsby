Although I’m no longer in Iraq, I’m still following the news there with interest, as many of us are. Yesterday there were a number of interesting blog posts describing events of election day in Iraq that I wanted to share here. First, a self-declared anti-Bush blogger from Washington DC took his camera to the nearest polling center for Iraqi ex-patriates and interviewed several of the voters there. I particularly enjoyed his very honest quote here:

> *You may think that you have felt dumb before, but let me tell you something: until you have stood in front of a man who knows real pain and told him that you are against your country’s alleviation of his country’s state-sponsored murderous suffering, you have not felt truly, deeply, like a total fucking moron.*

Read his complete coverage of the event, complete with many excellent comments, [here](http://andiamnotlyingforreal.blogspot.com/2005/01/like-millions-of-iraqis-i-made-long.html).

Some other blogs I found (linked mainly from [www.instapundit.com](http://www.instapundit.com/) I think) compared pictures of US anti-war protesters with Iraqis who had suffered in order to be able to vote. [This one](http://www.freewillblog.com/index.php/weblog/comments/5094) includes a quote that I love, too:

> *Why don’t we see the human shields at the polls in Iraq? They were willing to protect Iraq from bombs before the war started. Why aren’t they protecting Iraq now?*

Finally, [SondraK’s post](http://www.sondrak.com/archive/005050.php) puts a picture of an Iraqi who was apparently beaten on his way to the ballots up in comparison to a picture of a very stupid looking pro-insurgent American protester, so that we can compare the two and decide which one has a better idea of what freedom is and what it costs.
