There’s a nice little [series of tutorials at NibblesTutorials that goes through some Silverlight basics](http://www.nibblestutorials.net/) (using Silverlight). I haven’t had a chance to go through them all yet (naturally) but it definitely looks like good stuff.

Also NetikaTech has announced [a set of controls for Silverlight](http://www.netikatech.com/products) which include both free and pro versions. I haven’t played with these yet either but it looks like a pretty good start considering that Silverlight has almost no “real” controls in it for business-class applications.
