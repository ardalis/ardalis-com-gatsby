I won’t be speaking but I’ll likely be one of their volunteer experts, doing stuff with MVPs, ASPInsiders, INETA, CodeWise/CodeZone, etc. I’m looking forward to seeing many of my .NET community friends there, most of whom I haven’t seen in over a year.

I’m~~tentatively~~speaking on what’s new with ASP.NET in 2.0. I don’t have a URL for this event yet.\
