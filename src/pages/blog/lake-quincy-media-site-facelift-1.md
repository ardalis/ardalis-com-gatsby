[Lake Quincy Media](http://lakequincy.com/), the advertising network made up exclusively of .NET developer community web sites, has been undergoing a substantial redesign throughout the month of July. Well, after a lot of work, the new design was launched yesterday. The new design is, I think, much more professional and attractive than the one I managed to put together earlier this year, which is a credit to the design skills of our full time creative director, Craig. Have a look and let us know what you think, and if youâ€™re interested in running .NET-centric advertisements on your blog or community site, let us know.
