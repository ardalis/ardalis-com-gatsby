I spoke to a Captain in Leonardwood yesterday at the Training Support Battalion (TSB) where I‚Äùll be for my stay there. She was able to answer a few of my questions. I'm welcome to bring a laptop to FLW but she has no idea where I'll be billeting or whether I'll have the ability to get to the Internet (she knows I won't be allowed to use a personal laptop on the army network). She also wasn't so sure it would be wise to bring the laptop to wherever I'm going, depending on where that might be ([Michelle](http://armysteve.com/armyspouse) found a link to these [Pelican Laptop cases](http://www.casesbypelican.com/pelican-laptop-case-series.htm) which I guess many soldiers in Iraq are using, though).

I got some idea for who I'll be training with and what I'll be doing, too. Basically, I arrive on a Saturday and I'm pretty much free through Monday morning with some restrictions. Michelle will most likely stay the weekend (off-post) and get her ID card Monday, then head home to Ohio. For me, Monday will mean lots of paperwork, shots, and medical exams. I'll be going through the process with 4 or 5 other lieutenenants, whom I'm assuming are all engineers as well. After the first couple-three days of in-processing, I'm switched over to the TSB where I'll get some CTT (common task training) refresher training (weapons qualification, chemical warfare protective measures, basic soldier skills). The CTT training takes about a week, then we'll be at the Engineer School (where I went for 5 months for Engineer Officer Basic Course (EOBC)) for a couple of weeks of refresher engineer training.

Around the last week of all of this, I should receive orders for my destination unit, and at the end of the training in FLW I will be shipped to a CRC (CONUS Replacement Center, I think) where I'll get my weapon and the last of my field gear. Most likely that will be Ft. Sill, OK, which is where I went for basic training in 1995. That would be around late June. From there, I'll be going wherever I'm going.
