[Guy](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=8bdaa836-0bba-4393-94db-6c3c4a0c98a1&DisplayLang=en) pointed out a great resource for learning the newly released Visual Studio 2008 for free: the [Visual Studio 2008 and .NET Framework 3.5 Training Kit](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=8bdaa836-0bba-4393-94db-6c3c4a0c98a1&DisplayLang=en), from Microsoft. To quote the site:

> [](<>)The Visual Studio 2008 and .NET Framework 3.5 Training Kit includes presentations, hands-on labs, and demos. This content is designed to help you learn how to utilize the Visual Studio 2008 features and a variety of framework technologies including: LINQ, C# 3.0, Visual Basic 9, WCF, WF, WPF, ASP.NET AJAX, VSTO, CardSpace, SilverLight, Mobile and Application Lifecycle Management.

I’m downloading it now, but it definitely sounds like it would be worthwhile. 72.8MB of goodness – at least that’s a much smaller download than VS2008 itself.
