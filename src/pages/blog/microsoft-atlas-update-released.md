This week Microsoft has updated the latest version of Microsoft Atlas. You can download the March CTP from <http://atlas.asp.net/>. You’ll find step-by-step installation instructions, documentation, and sample applications [here](http://atlas.asp.net/default.aspx?tabid=47&subtabid=471). And of course if you do build something cool, don’t forget to enter it in the [Mash It Up With Atlas Contest](http://ardalis.com/blogs/ssmith/archive/2006/03/20/Microsoft_Atlas_Contest.aspx).

I’ve heard it rumored there’s a Go Live license with this version but I’m not seeing any reference to that on the website — perhaps it’s in the installer. I’ll update this post once I confirm.

**Update**: Confirmed by [Nikhil](http://www.nikhilk.net/Entry.aspx?id=112). Atlas M2 = Atlas March CTP. And yes, you can use it in live sites.
