I have trouble, as a long time Microsoft developer community member and (dare I say) community leader, believing that someone could miss the fact that there are Microsoft communities and, by extension, community members and fans. I would definitely consider myself a fan of Microsoft’s products. I’m not lacking in criticism when there are things that are broken, mind you, but overall I’d definitely classify myself as a fan.

And, of course, I know I’m not alone.

I know a lot of other Microsoft fans. I know there are thousands of them on the [AspAdvice mailing lists](http://aspadvice.com/lists) and [forums](http://aspadvice.com/forums). I know there are tens of thousands of them on the [ASP.NET Forums](http://forums.asp.net/) and [Microsoft Forums](http://forums.microsoft.com/). There are probably even a few still using Usenet (ducks for cover). So take this opportunity to raise your hand so that folks like [John McBride](http://arstechnica.com/authors.ars/johnmcbride)at [arstechnica](http://arstechnica.com/index.ars) know that Microsoft does, in fact, have fans, in response to this article:
