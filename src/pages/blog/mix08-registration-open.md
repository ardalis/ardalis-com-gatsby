Here’s some official information on the [MIX 2008](http://www.visitmix.com/2008/index.html) conference hosted by Microsoft in Las Vegas next March:

> Registration for Microsoft’s MIX08 opened on Thursday, November 8th. Slated for March 5- 7 at The Venetian Resort Hotel Casino in Las Vegas, MIX08 is the event for professionals in the consumer Web space – Web developers, designers, business and digital marketing professionals – to come together to explore new ways to build next generation Web experiences with Microsoft’s platform and create more dynamic customer connections that drive business results.
>
> Information on registration and accommodations is available now at <http://www.visitmix.com/2008> . MIX has a history of selling out fast so we encourage everyone to register early.

Assuming I make it this time, this will be my first MIX event despite having planned to attend the previous two shows (I had to skip it in the past due to a prior user group talk the first year and a trip to Russia this year). I’m really looking forward to going as I’ve heard nothing but good things about the show, and it’s supposed to be a very different experience from TechEd/PDC/DevConnections, which I regularly attend. I hope to meet some of you there!
