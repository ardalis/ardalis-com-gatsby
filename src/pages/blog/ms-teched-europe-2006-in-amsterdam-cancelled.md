According to [Bink.nu](http://bink,.nu/) (and confirmed by my secret sources), Microsoft TechEd Europe 2006 has been rescheduled into two separate events. From Bink’s post:

*“To better serve the developer and IT professional communities in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, Microsoft is evolving its pan-European technical events (Tech Ed Europe and IT Forum) in 2006.”*



*“**Microsoft Tech Ed 2006: Developers**” will be a deep-dive technical event addressing the specific requirements of developers while “**Microsoft Tech Ed 2006: IT Forum**” will be replacing IT Forum but will retain its focus on IT professionals and their distinctive needs.*

*The two conferences will for the first time run back-to-back in November 2006, creating Microsoft’s premier technical education platform in the region and a central feature of the IT industry calendar.*
