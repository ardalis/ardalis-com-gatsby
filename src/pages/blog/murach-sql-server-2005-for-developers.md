Recently I picked up a copy of [Murach's SQL Server 2005 For Developers](http://www.murach.com/books/sql5/toc.htm), and while I haven’t had a chance to really read it through cover to cover, I have read the first few chapters and skimmed the rest. It’s a meaty book, and is actually not a first edition as the name might imply but is a third revision book (with a new title) — meaning that there are no glaring holes in it that first-time efforts sometimes have.

Ok, so it’s a book on SQL Server 2005, that’s obvious. But why is it interesting compared to so many other such books? The main reason is that it is very approachable – there is not a lot of dense text, just simple explanations of how things work. This makes it a fairly quick read. The other feature this book has which separates it from the pack, which I **LOVE** is Murach’s standard layout pattern with explanation on the left page and code samples and figures on the right page. This is an extremely easy to use format for technical how-to manuals, because the code and the explanation are always together, with no page-flipping required.

If you have the book, or are considering buying it, feel free to post your questions and feedback below.
