Ok, here's a bunch of publicly available info on Kirkush/Caldwell/Balad Ruz that I picked up over the last couple of weeks but didn't post because I didn't want to disclose where I was going until I got here for security reasons.

[Robert Alt describes his trip to FOB Caldwell](http://noleftturns.ashbrook.org/default.asp?archiveID=4155) in May 2004

A [picture I found with Google](http://www.geocities.com/guidonsforward/Saber_Base_KMTB.jpg) (don't know who took it or when)

NewsObserver posted [this article](http://www.newsandobserver.com/news/nation_world/story/1358819p-7482023c.html) just a few weeks ago, which describes the trip by road between Balad and Caldwell. Luckily, we managed to get a flight via Chinook (25 minutes) instead of a 2.5 hour convoy.

Kirkush Military Training Base is described [here](http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/kirkush.htm).

[This Fayetteville article](http://www.fayettevillenc.com/story.php?Template=war&Story=6437934) describes the unit I'm with. It requires a subscription, but Google has a cached version [here](http://216.239.39.104/search?q=cache:7-tJEs-z8VgJ:www.fayettevillenc.com/story.php%3FTemplate%3Dwar%26Story%3D6437934+camp+caldwell+iraq+north+carolina&hl=en) for now.

I don't have a place to sleep yet and I don't know what my job will be yet, but I expect those things to change in the next week or so.
