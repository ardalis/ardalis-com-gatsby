I’m updating my blog’s home and moving to [Graffiti](http://graffiticms.com/) and my own domain, [SteveSmithBlog.com](http://stevesmithblog.com/). I’m hoping that I’ll be able to be a bit better about blogging as well, as my total volume of posts has dropped off of late (10 in June, 9 in May, 16 in April for a total of 35 for the quarter – compared to 52 in Q1). Anyway, this is mainly a test post so we’ll keep it short.
