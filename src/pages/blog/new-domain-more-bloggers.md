I've registered [ArmyAdvice.org](http://armyadvice.org) and mapped my [ArmySteve.com](http://aspadvice.org/armysteve) domain to it. If you're just interested in me, you'll want to go to [http://armyadvice.org/ArmySteve/](http://armyadvice.org/ArmySteve). The main url at [http://ArmyAdvice.org/](http://armyadvice.org) will show posts from a growing number of army bloggers. I've set up three this weekend; guys in my platoon or whom I've met since getting called up. I expect that number to grow as word spreads of free blog space for soldiers.
