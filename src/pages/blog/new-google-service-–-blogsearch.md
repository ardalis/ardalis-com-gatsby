Google seems to be at it again with more new services. I just ran across [BlogSearch](http://blogsearch.google.com/), which might not be totally new but this is the first I’ve seen it. There are a lot of Steven Smith’s out there and I’m nowhere near the top in main [Google Search](http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&rls=GGLR,GGLR:2005-44,GGLR:en&q=steven+smith), but I’m the top 2 hits (at the moment) in [BlogSearch:Steven Smith](http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en&q=steven+smith). I haven’t used the tool enough to know if it’s very useful, but I like the idea.
