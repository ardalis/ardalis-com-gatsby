Craig, Lake Quincy Media’s Creative Director, updated my blog from the generic theme I’d been using today. Let me know how you like it (if you’re reading this in an RSS reader, click [here](http://stevesmithblog.com/)). I like it but I’m a bit biased. I’m also curious, as a reader, do you prefer seeing full posts on the home page or just summaries (for example: [Rob Howard](http://grokable.com/) or [ScottW’s blogs](http://simpable.com/)).

Please post a comment with your thoughts! Thanks!
