[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/41202726@N00/2219377017 "DSC04580")Today we brought home our new puppy, a mastiff boy with brindle coloration whom we have named Odin. So far heâ€™s doing well, learning his way around the new home, playing with the kids, and getting to know our three cats who are completely terrified of him. Life will be fun at our house for a while. Here are some pictures for those who might care.[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/41202726@N00/2219375709 "DSC04578")
