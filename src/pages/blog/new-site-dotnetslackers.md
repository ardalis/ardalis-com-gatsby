A new site I’m using to push me updates of interesting blogs is [DotNetSlackers.com](http://www.dotnetslackers.com/). Sign up for their mail service, and you’ll get a single daily email with that day’s posts arranged by keyword category. I’ve been pretty lax in firing up my RSS aggregator client, so this is a good way for me to at least make sure I’m not missing anything big in the .NET blogging world. Another similar site worth checking out, if you’re a VB-er, is [VBFeeds.com](http://www.vbfeeds.com/), although I’m a bit late in announcing that one.
