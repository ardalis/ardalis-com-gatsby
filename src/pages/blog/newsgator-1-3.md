I’ve never used [Newsgator](http://www.newsgator.com/downloads.aspx) before but since I just redid the [RSS feed on AspAlliance.com](http://aspalliance.com/rss.aspx) I thought I should give it a shot and see how it works (I’ve also only recently gone to Outlook from Outlook Express (see past archives for my thoughts on the switch)). I have to say I really like it and am starting to subscribe to a bunch of blogs that previously I would manually periodically check with my browser (I know, how archaic is THAT). So now, that thing on the side of my blog that says ‘Blogs I Read’ will actually be a bit more accurate, since I’ll get notified of new posts to those blogs in semi-realtime.

Sweet.
