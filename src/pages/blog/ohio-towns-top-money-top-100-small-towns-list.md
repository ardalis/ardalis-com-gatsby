[Money](http://money.cnn.com/) recently released their [2009 list of America’s best small towns](http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/bplive/2009/top100/index.html)(which, living in a small town, I was curious about). Their Top 100 List includes towns in 32 US states. I’ve long felt that the Midwest is an excellent place to live in terms of quality of life and cost-of-living, and likewise I’ve always preferred living in the suburbs over urban life. I’ve done both, but I much prefer the privacy and convenience of the low-traffic, free parking, actually having a yard lifestyle found outside of concrete jungles.

Especially in light of the current economy, areas that have a lower cost of living, more reasonable real estate prices, etc. are a much safer bet than those where the real estate boom/bust hit hardest. While the unemployment rate in some parts of Ohio is quite dismal, the overall real estate prices didn’t take too much of a dip, and people are still able to buy and sell (and build) homes here.

For software developers, we have a great community here. We have conferences like [CodeMash](http://codemash.org/), smaller events like the [Central Ohio Day of .NET](http://www.dayofdotnet.org/PastEvents.aspx), and loads of user groups like the [Hudson Software Craftsmanship](http://hudsonsc.com/) group that is starting up next month.
