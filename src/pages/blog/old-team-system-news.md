This is all from last month, but I’ve been busy so it’s been in my queue. Sorry for the late “news”:

Microsoft acquired TeamPlain, makers of TeamPlain Web Access for connecting to TFS via a browser. **TeamPlain will be free to anybody with a TFS CAL**. [Full announcement](http://blogs.msdn.com/bharry/archive/2007/03/26/microsoft-acquires-teamplain.aspx).

Patterns and practices announced the publication of prescriptive guidance for TFS/VSTS. [JD Meier had the details](http://blogs.msdn.com/jmeier/archive/2007/03/26/vsts-guidance-project-update.aspx).

In related news, the VSTS team published 40 pages of strategies for branching and merging with TFS on CodePlex, [here](http://www.codeplex.com/BranchingGuidance).
