I’m still on the Beta of Outlook 2003 – I’ll upgrade to the release version at some point. But I just installed [SpamBayes](http://spambayes.sourceforge.net/windows.html) and I have to say that so far I’m very happy with it. It’s not totally “trained” yet (it’s only been about 8 hours, but I get about 100 spam in that time), but it’s only categorized 2 things I wanted to have as possible spam (and they were automated emails), and nothing has been junked that shouldn’t have been. No spam has made it to my Inbox, either – it’s all been put into Possible Spam.

Anyway, thought I’d share and follow up to my previous [post reviewing Outlook 2003](http://weblogs.asp.net/ssmith/posts/8569.aspx).
