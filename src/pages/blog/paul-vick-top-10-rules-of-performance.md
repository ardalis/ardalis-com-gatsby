I was just referred to [this](http://www.panopticoncentral.net/PermaLink.aspx/eacfc5e0-42df-44b0-bb9a-94354b689b17) by [Darren Neimke](http://weblogs.asp.net/dneimke/archive/2004/02/11/70783.aspx). It’s a great top 10 list of things to do/not to do when you’re trying to increase the performance of an application. Being a scalability and performance kind of guy, I really enjoyed the read, and must blog about it so that I can find it in the future.
