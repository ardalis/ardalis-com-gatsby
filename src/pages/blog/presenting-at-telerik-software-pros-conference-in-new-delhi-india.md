Today I gave two sessions at the Telerik Software Professionals Conference in New Delhi, India. The event is still ongoing (Chris Sells is wrapping up a great talk on building Windows 8 apps with HTML5 and JavaScript), but I wanted to get my talks posted here for attendees to download and review. Iâ€™ve loaded them on Slideshare, so you should be able to view them here, or navigate to Slideshare to get the slides themselves.
