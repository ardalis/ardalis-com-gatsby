I’ll be speaking to the [Cleveland .NET SIG](http://www.bennettadelson.com/technicalresources/sig.aspx) tomorrow night about .NET Caching Best Practices, my current (and somewhat longstanding) favorite topic. If you’re in the area, stop by and say hello. The details:

Next Meeting:\

Location:\
Microsoft Corporation\

[RSVP here](http://www.bennettadelson.com/technicalresources/sig.aspx) so they have enough food and such if you’re planning to attend.

I’m going to be bringing a bunch of SWAG I’ve been collecting from TechEd and other sources, too. Hope to see you there.
