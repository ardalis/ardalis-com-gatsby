[](http://regexlib.com/ "RegexLib-Now")We’ve done some design work on the [Regular Expression Library](http://regexlib.com/), and cleaned up the code base significantly to get rid of some cruft and fix a few bugs. The site gets a surprisingly large amount of traffic, considering how esoteric a topic regular expressions are, and hopefully the new design will make it that much easier for people to search for [regular expression examples](http://regexlib.com/). You can see some of its earlier (and much uglier) designs in the [Internet Archive Wayback Machine](http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://regexlib.com), which has archives of the site dating back to September of 2001.

If you have suggestions for RegExLib.com, please let us know. One thing I think I want to start doing more of is adding additional reference material to the site, such as articles, tutorials, and walkthroughs. Another feature that should come in the next update (probably 3-6 months from now) will be tagging support for the expressions, which should make it much easier to locate the expression you need.
