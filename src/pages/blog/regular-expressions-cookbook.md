I just received a notice that O’Reilly is publishing a new [Regular Expressions Cookbook](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596520689?ie=UTF8&tag=aspalliancecom&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0596520689). It’s not available yet, so I can’t offer a review, but I’m certainly a fan of Cookbook style books (like [this one](http://aspalliance.com/cookbook)), because of their simple, problem-solution organization. The authors are notable regular expression experts, so I expect there will be some good material here.

Other regular expression resources and tools:

* [Regular Expression Library](http://regexlib.com/)– hundreds of pre-written and tested expressions covering many common use cases
* [Regular Expression Construction Forum](http://regexadvice.com/forums/68/ShowForum.aspx)– get advice on writing and optimizing your regular expressions
