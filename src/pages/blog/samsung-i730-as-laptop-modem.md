I got this working once a year or so ago when I first got my phone but then haven’t messed with it since. So recently I thought about it again and now I’m using Vista so I wasn’t sure how challenging it would be. Turned out to be pretty painless following the instructions from [this post](http://mobilitytoday.com/news.php?n=005047&p=samsung_i730_laptop_connection).

***Go to the phone app and then press: \*\*PATH (which is \*\*7284)***

***You can then select USB and then plug the i730 in to your computer. It should automatically install the Samsung USB modem drivers and you should not see activesync popup/connect. You may need to download these Samsung [MCCI](http://www.samsung.com/download/FileView.aspx?cttfileid=220398&type=Mobile+Phone&typecode=18&subtype=Mobile+Phone&subtypecode=1805&model=SCH-I730&filetype=SW&language=) drivers. You then need to make a new [network](http://mobilitytoday.com/news.php?n=005047&p=samsung_i730_laptop_connection#) connection that dials: #777 with the username: yourtendigitnumber@vzw3g.com and password: vzw***
