[Scott](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu)writes:

*What*

we’ve set out to do is to make it dramatically easier for anyone to build

AJAX-style web applications that deliver rich, interactive, and personalized

experiences. Developers should be able to build these applications without great

expertise in client scripting; they should be able to integrate their browser UI

seamlessly with the rest of their applications; and they should be able to

*develop and debug these applications with ease.*

*For*

this work, we’ve been working on a new project on our team, codenamed

“**Atlas”**. Our goal is to produce a developer preview release on top of

ASP.NET 2.0 for the PDC this September, and then have a website where we can

keep updating the core bits, publishing samples, and building an active

*community around it.*
