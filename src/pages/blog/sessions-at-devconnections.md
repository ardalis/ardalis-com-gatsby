I’m leaving in the morning for Las Vegas for [ASP.NET Connections](http://www.devconnections.com/shows/aspfall2005/default.asp?s=65), where I understand attendance is extremely high relative to expectations, no doubt related to the fact that Microsoft is launching many of their new dev products this week. I’m going to be hosting three sessions this week and look forward to meeting folks in person whom I’ve only gotten to know through my blog, mailing lists, forums, emails, IMs, etc, etc. Here’s where I’ll be:
