[ComponentArt](http://componentart.com/) recently announced their [Summer Silverlight Coding Competition](http://www.componentart.com/community/competition2009), running June 22nd to September 22nd this summer. Already there are a bunch of submissions to the contest, although there’s still lots of time left before the contest is over. The winner will be determined based on the results of community voting combined with a panel of judges, so you can help decide which of these apps deserves to win the huge $10,000 prize for being the best application.

Check out the list of contestants and their apps [here](http://www.componentart.com/community/competition2009/contestants.aspx).
