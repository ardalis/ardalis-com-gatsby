Wow, even Slashdot, anti-Microsoft capital of the Web, acknowledges that six months after its release, [Vista Security is still besting Linux](http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/06/27/024204). From the site:

> “Great report on [security vulnerabilities for MS/Linux/OS X](http://blogs.csoonline.com/windows_vista_6_month_vulnerability_report). This is a revised version of the one Jeff Jones did back on March 21: [Windows Vista — 90 Day Vulnerability Report](http://blogs.csoonline.com/node/218). This time he did what the Linux community had asked. Everyone complained that he did the report based on a *full* Linux distro including optional components, not on just a base OS install. So this time he did both; Vista still came out on top. I was shocked that Apple was even on the list as I believed all those Mac commercials!”

[Full story](http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/06/27/024204).

Oddly the moderator posted the story as “maybe-because-nobody’s-using-it” which is rather ironic since Linux [ranks third](http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_os.asp) in total user base behind Windows and Macs (and as a result, far fewer “black hats” target if they’re seeking maximum reach for their exploits). According to [W3Schools’ stats for May](http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_os.asp), Linux does have 0.2% more user base than Vista, but Vista’s share has increased 2.5% since January while Linux has dropped 0.3%.
