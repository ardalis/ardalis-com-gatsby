Next week I’ll be one of several speakers at a free one-day event being held at the Microsoft office in Independence, Ohio. The event is designed for Microsoft developers who are seeking to improve their skills in software engineering, including object-oriented design, design patterns, and automated testing. The event is being hosted by Microsoft and organized by the [Hudson Software Craftsmanship group](http://hudsonsc.com/) and [Nimble Pros consulting services](http://nimblepros.com/).

Initially there were 50 slots available – I think there are about 15-20 left as of today. The event is scheduled for 16 July 2010 from 830am to 4pm, so if you can get approval to come for some free hands-on training, sign up fast before it’s sold out.

You can register for the event and view the agenda [here](http://nimblepros.com/news-and-events/software-engineering-101---cleveland.aspx). If you’re planning on attending the Cleveland Give Camp, there will be a number of folks going to both, and the SWE101 event should wrap up in plenty of time to make it to the Give Camp.
