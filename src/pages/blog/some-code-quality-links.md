Caught a couple of nice links from @unclebobmartin via twitter this morning that I thought were worth sharing. The first one is [a very nice summary of the Software Craftsmanship conference that took place last week in London](http://www.kerrybuckley.org/2009/03/02/software-craftsmanship-2009). From reading this review, it sounds like there were a lot of very interesting and interactive sessions. The author,[Kerry Buckley](http://www.kerrybuckley.org/), shows off his own mind-map of software development practices which I think is pretty cool (using [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/) and including such things as [TATFT](http://www.google.com/search?q=tatft "Test All The F-ing Time"),[TDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development), and [YAGNI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Ain%27t_Gonna_Need_It). I’d be interested in seeing how others’ graphs differed and what a composite graph might have looked like. I’m also intrigued by the ideas of katas for self-improvement as a developer (described in another session). I’m a practicing*isshin-ryu*karate-ka, and one of the reasons I chose martial arts is because of the greater degree of knowledge, discipline, and self-improvement that it provides in comparison to, say, walking on a treadmill. There’s some interesting discussion of katas as a means to gather constructive criticism from peers, which I also think is valuable.

There’s a lot more interesting stuff in the post ([read it](http://www.kerrybuckley.org/2009/03/02/software-craftsmanship-2009)), and I hope soon there will be more of these conferences, especially in the US (there is an active [Software Craftsmanship group in Chicago](http://groups.softwarecraftsmanship.org/)).

Another Uncle Bob link is [a review of his book, Clean Code](http://java.dzone.com/reviews/clean-code-handbook-agile), which I expect will be waiting for me when I return home from the MVP summit later this week. I’ll be sure to post my own review once I’ve had a chance to read it. (oh, and if you haven’t read [Uncle Bob’s articles](http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/publishedArticles.html), I highly recommend them, in addition to the [10 papers every developer should read that Michael Feathers recently posted](http://blog.objectmentor.com/articles/2009/02/26/10-papers-every-programmer-should-read-at-least-twice), which I’m still working through).
