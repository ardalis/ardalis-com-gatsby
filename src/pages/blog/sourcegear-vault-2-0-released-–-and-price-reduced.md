Eric Sink of SourceGear talks about why they’ve opted to drop their prices – mostly they’ve adopted a very reasonable volume licensing scheme which I like a lot better than their previous $400/user no-matter-how-many model. I must admit I was one of the many whiners about their old pricing model, and it’s nice to see that SourceGear as a company listens to their users’ feedback (which I already knew, since I’m on their Vault discussion list). Hmm, I’d link to their support mailing list signup page, but I can’t find it. However, I did just find their [support forums](http://support.sourcegear.com/), so I’ll link to those…

Anyway, I haven’t upgraded to 2.0 of [Vault](http://sourcegear.com/vault)yet (which I use for all of my AspAlliance development), but once I do, I’ll be sure to write about how I like it.
