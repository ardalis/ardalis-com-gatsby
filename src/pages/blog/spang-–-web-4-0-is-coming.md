Plip already [let the cat out of the bag](http://weblogs.asp.net/Plip/archive/2005/10/03/426444.aspx), but I feel obliged to blog about Spang as well. Sadly, beyond the name, we aren’t allowed to share any more, but if you’re a web developer you should expect to hear more about it “soon”.

**Update**: [WhatIsSpang.com](http://whatisspang.com/) announced.
