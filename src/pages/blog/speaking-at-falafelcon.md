[](http://www.falafel.com/falafel-con-2013)Hey, California people, I’m coming your way. I’ll be speaking at [FalafelCon 2013](http://www.falafel.com/falafel-con-2013) next month about Refactoring with SOLID Principles. The event is taking place 10-11 June 2013 at [Microsoft’s Silicon Valley campus](http://www.falafel.com/falafel-con-2013/venue). The speaker lineup looks pretty awesome, with keynotes from [Scott Hanselman](https://twitter.com/shanselman), [Stephen Forte](https://twitter.com/worksonmypc), [Michele Bustamante](https://twitter.com/michelebusta), and [Tim Huckaby](https://twitter.com/TimHuckaby), and tracks covering Web, Mobile, [Sitefinity](http://sitefinity.com/), and TestComplete.

My session will briefly cover the SOLID principles of object-oriented design, which you can of course learn more about in my [Pluralsight course on SOLID Principles of Object Oriented Design](http://pluralsight.com/training/courses/TableOfContents?courseName=principles-oo-design&highlight=). In addition to discussing each principle, this presentation also demonstrates how, through simple refactoring techniques, programming structures that are causing you as the developer pain can be improved, resulting in a better design. As it happens, I’m currently working on a course on Refactoring for Pluralsight, which I hope to add to [my list of published courses](http://pluralsight.com/training/Authors/Details/steve-smith) there soon.

If you’re in the area, I hope you’ll attend. If you do, please let me know how you enjoyed the presentation.
