I found out a few days ago that I’ll be speaking at the [Fall ASP.NET Connections show](http://www.devconnections.com/shows/ASPFall2005/default.asp?s=65). I didn’t make it to last Fall’s, which I was also scheduled to speak at, which really depressed me. It was going to be my first time in Vegas, and my birthday. But it looks like perhaps I’ll still get my chance, since it’s **still** in Vegas, and it’s **once again** spanning my birthday.

You can view the full list of [speakers](http://www.devconnections.com/shows/ASPFall2005/default.asp?c=2&s=65) and [sessions](http://www.devconnections.com/shows/ASPFall2005/default.asp?c=1&s=65) for the show on its [website](http://www.devconnections.com/shows/ASPFall2005/default.asp?s=65).



My sessions are:

* Caching Features in ASP.NET 2.0 with SQL Server 2005
* Unit Testing and Build Management in .NET Applications (Part 1 — .NET 1.1)
* Unit Testing and Build Management in .NET Applications (Part 2 — .NET 2.0)

Hopefully Whidbey will RTM before the show. If anybody reading this is interested, I may share some of my presentation materials with my half dozen blog subscribers to get some feedback before the show. Comment if you would care, otherwise I’ll stick to my usual technique of~~just making stuff up and faking my way through demos~~working endlessly with no feedback to try to ensure everything is perfect.
