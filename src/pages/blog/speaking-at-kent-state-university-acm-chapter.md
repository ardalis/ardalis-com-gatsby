  228 of the Match and Comp Sci building. It’s sort of a dry run for a session
  I’ll be giving at TechEd in May, but also geared more toward students. I’ll be

I’m giving a talk this week at [Kent State University on ASP.NET MVC and SOLID principles](http://www.cs.kent.edu/research/seminars.html?Seminar_ID=135). It will be at 3:45pm on Wednesday, April 8th, in room 228 of the Match and Comp Sci building. It’s sort of a dry run for a session I’ll be giving at [TechEd](http://msteched.com/) in May, but also geared more toward students. I’ll be sure to post the slides and demos here as usual afterward. If you’re a student at KSU or are in the area, please feel free to stop by (the event is open to the public). My plan is to spend a very small amount of time describing MVC (and ASP.NET), and the bulk of the time discussing best practices for OOP culled mainly from [Robert C. Martin’s](http://www.objectmentor.com/omTeam/martin_r.html) books, such as these:

[Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns, and Practices](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0135974445?ie=UTF8&tag=aspalliancecom&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0135974445)

[Agile Principles, Patterns, and Practices in C#](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0131857258?ie=UTF8&tag=aspalliancecom&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0131857258)

[Clean Code](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0132350882?ie=UTF8&tag=aspalliancecom&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0132350882)

I’m most of the way through the last book, and I’m thinking it may have to replace (or certainly augment) [Code Complete](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0735619670?ie=UTF8&tag=aspalliancecom&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0735619670) as one of the books all developers should read. Might have to update my [Favorite Developer Books post](/favorite-developer-books) soon.
