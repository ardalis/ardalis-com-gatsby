This week I’ll be presenting my TechEd session on SOLIDifying ASP.NET MVC applications to the [Cleveland .NET SIG](http://www.bennettadelson.com/netsig.aspx) in Independence and the [Ann Arbor .Net Developer’s Group](http://aadnd.org/)(in Ann Arbor, MI). The talk’s main purpose is to introduce developers to “Uncle Bob” Martin’s principles of software design (which can be arranged into the acroacronym SOLID) and to drive home the point that just because you’re using ASP.NET MVC doesn’t mean you’re writing better code. I show a very simple (and poorly designed) ASP.NET MVC application, and, after identifying its many “issues,” I implement changes based on the SOLID principles until the resulting code is much better.

If you don’t know who “Uncle Bob” is, or what SOLID is, I strongly encourage you to attend. If you’re already in the choir I’m preaching to, please come along so you can help answer questions and engage in the inevitable discussion that this topic generates.
