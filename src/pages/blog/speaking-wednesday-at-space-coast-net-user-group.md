[I gave this same talk last week to the Kent State ACM chapter](http://stevesmithblog.com/blog/speaking-at-kent-state-university-acm-chapter) and it went pretty well. I plan to tweak the demos a bit before this presentation. Ultimately, I’m giving this same talk at TechEd in LA in about a month, so these events are providing sneak previews of what’s to come at TechEd.
