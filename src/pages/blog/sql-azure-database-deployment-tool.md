If you’re playing with SQL Azure, the current (pre-release) process of moving an existing local SQL Server to SQL Azure can be greatly improved using a new [SQL Azure Migration Wizard tool that’s being hosted at CodePlex](http://sqlazuremw.codeplex.com/). Wade Wegner [blogged about the tool yesterday](http://blog.wadewegner.com/index.php/2009/09/01/sql-azure-migration-wizard), and his post includes a screencast showing how to use the wizard. Check it out if you’re interested in hosting your data in the Azure cloud.
