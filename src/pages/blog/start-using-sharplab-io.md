SharpLab.io is a fantastic tool for .NET developers that allows them to see the compiled output of their code, compare different language versions, and explore intermediate language (IL) code.

Here are some tips for using SharpLab.io as a .NET developer:

### Tips for using SharpLab.io as a .NET developer

1. Choose the correct language version: SharpLab.io supports multiple languages, such as [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/), [F#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/), and [VB.NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/). Make sure to select the appropriate version that you are currently working on. You can even use IL as your input language.

2. Use the correct target framework: You can choose the target framework version by clicking on dropdown above the input editor. You can choose from the latest default dotnet SDK or target older versions based on different Roslyn branches.

3. Experiment with different compiler options: SharpLab.io allows you to experiment with different compiler options by clicking on the gear icon in the top right corner of the screen. For example, you can enable or disable certain features or change the optimization level.

4. Compare different language versions: SharpLab.io allows you to compare the compiled output of your code across different language versions. This is useful for understanding the differences in behavior or performance between different language versions. 

5. Explore intermediate language code: SharpLab.io allows you to explore the intermediate language code (IL) generated by the .NET compiler. This is useful for understanding how your code is actually executed by the .NET runtime.

Overall, [SharpLab.io](https://sharplab.io/) is a powerful tool for .NET developers to explore and experiment with their code. By following these tips, you can get the most out of this tool and improve your .NET development skills.
