[Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/) is one of my heroes. His .NET knowledge is tremendous and he’s just a really good guy. He has diabetes, on May 6th he’s going to be walking to fight diabetes with [Team Hanselman](http://walk.diabetes.org/site/TR?pg=personal&fr_id=3418&px=2784611). The goal is to raise $10,000 for the cause. If you want to learn more, or learn how you might help, see Scott’s post:
