I arrived in Orlando last night. I’m staying at the [Disney Swan (and Dolphin)](http://www.swandolphin.com/). I’m planning on making it to [Palermo’s Party](http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeffrey.palermo/archive/2007/05/20/party-with-palermo-tech-ed-2007-edition-official-announcement.aspx) this evening, though I may be late as I have other engagements. I’m looking forward to meeting up with a lot of friends this week, since I had to miss the spring [DevConnections](http://www.devconnections.com/) show due to [other commitments](http://aspadvice.com/blogs/ssmith/archive/2007/05/11/New-Arrival.aspx). I’m also looking forward to seeing a lot of [Lake Quincy Media’](http://lakequincy.com/)s customers and publishers and showing of our new  [AdSignia](http://lakequincy.com/AdSignia) tool. Today I’m meeting with my fellow Regional Directors, and you’ll find me this week spending a fair bit of time at the RD Booth, where we’re going to be showing off our new website, [The Region](http://microsoftregionaldirectors.com/).
