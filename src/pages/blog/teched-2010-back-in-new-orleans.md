[TechEd 2010](http://msteched.com/) will (finally) be back in New Orleans! The dates are June 7-11, 2010. It's been several years since I've been to New Orleans, but I always have a great time there and I'm very much looking forward to returning. The [food](http://mardi-gras-fun.com/mardi-gras-recipes-entrees.htm), music, and atmosphere are wonderful. I hope to see you there!
