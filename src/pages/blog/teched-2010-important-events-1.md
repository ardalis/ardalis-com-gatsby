If you’ll be attending TechEd in New Orleans in a couple of weeks, make sure the following are all on your calendar:



**Party with Palermo – TechEd 2010 Edition\
Sunday 6 June 2010 7:30-9:30pm Central Time**





[RSVP and see who else is coming here](http://partywithpalermo.eventbrite.com/). The party takes place from 7:30pm to 9:30pm Central (Local) Time, and includes a full meal, free swag, and prizes. The event is being held at Jimmy Buffett’s Margaritaville located at 1104 Decatur Street.



**Developer Practices Session: DPR304 FAIL: Anti-Patterns and Worst Practices\
Monday 7 June 2010 4:30pm-5:45pm Central Time\
Room 276**

Come to my session and hear about what NOT to do on your software project. Hear my own and others’ war stories and lessons learned. You’ll laugh, you’ll cry, you’ll realize you’re a much better developer than a lot of folks out there. Here’s the official description:

*Everybody likes to talk about best practices, tips, and tricks, but often it is by analyzing failures that we learn from our own and others’ mistakes. In this session, Steve describes various anti-patterns and worst practices in software development that he has encountered in his own experience or learned about from other experts in the field, along with advice on recognizing and avoiding them.*
