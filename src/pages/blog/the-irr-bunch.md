Captain Bunch was recently interviewed on CNN, and his family is quoted in this article, [Reserves Brace For Call-Up Notices](http://www.military.com/NewsContent/0,13319,FL_reserves_070104,00.html). He's with me now in Iraq. His CNN interview transcript is [here](http://cnnstudentnews.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0407/06/pzn.00.html). His story is a lot like mine, and he's also originally from Ohio. I missed the interview on CNN, though, since I was out-of-the-country... It sounds like it went really well, though.
