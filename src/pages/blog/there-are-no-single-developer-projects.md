This is a very clever thing to point out, and worth remembering when you’re tempted to take shortcuts using the excuse **“I’m the only one working on this code so I can wing it.”** Who you are today is not who you were yesterday, nor will you be the same person tomorrow. Write your code with the knowledge that *someone else* is going to have to maintain it, even if that someone else is you with a bit more experience (and probably a bit of lost knowledge about the details of what you’re working on right at this moment).
