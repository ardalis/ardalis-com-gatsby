Recently, Microsoft launched a new developer community aimed at helping career software developers facing challenges in the current economy. The site is called [Thrive](http://www.msdnevents.com/thrivedev), and I think the idea is that not only should you be able to survive the current economic climate, but if you play your cards right, you can*thrive*. There’s a lot of good material here from folks you probably already know (or should know):

* A 10-part podcast from[.NET Rocks](http://dotnetrocks.com/) on “Development in a Downturn” including interviews with many well-known developers
* A 32-part screencast series on “How to be a better developer”
* Step by Step resources to help get into new technologies
* Job Search functionality
* Local developer connection help (find user groups and bloggers in your area)

The site is organized into three parts: Advance Your Career, Enhance Your Skills, and Connect with Your Community. If you haven’t looked at it yet,[check Thrive out](http://www.microsoft.com/click/thrivedev/default.aspx) and see if there’s something there you might find valuable.
