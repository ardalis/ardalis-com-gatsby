I missed ASP.NET Connections this week, but I have been slowly getting back into my speaking and training schedule. I have two [INETA](http://www.ineta.org/) engagements coming up in the next couple months:

28 April 2005\
.[NET Developers Group in Central Ohio](http://dev1.eraserver.net/NetDevelopers/Default.aspx)\
Topic: Caching Best Practices in ASP.NET\
6pm at [Microsoft Polaris Building](http://dev1.eraserver.net/NetDevelopers/Directions.aspx)

12 May 2005\
[Greater Charleston .NET User Group](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/GCNUG)Topic: Caching Best Practices in ASP.NET\
6pm at [Blackbaud](http://www.blackbaud.com/)

For both of these topics I intend to discuss:

* Caching Pattern â€” the right way check the cache for a value, and if necessary, repopulate it ([article](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnaspp/html/aspnet-cachingtechniquesbestpract.asp))
* Cache Management / Configuration Best Practices
* Micro Caching (benefits of caching for short periods of time) ([article](http://aspalliance.com/251))
* Write Caching (or Batch Updating) (article pending)
* Whidbey Caching Features (based on latest build available)
