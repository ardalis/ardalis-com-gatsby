There is an [Upgrade](http://msdn.microsoft.com/asp.net/migration/upgrade/default.aspx)

[Center available on MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/asp.net/migration/upgrade/default.aspx)now for customers seeking to move from ASP.NET 1.x

to ASP.NET 2.0. It includes a [white](http://msdn.microsoft.com/asp.net/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnaspp/html/upgradingaspnet.asp)

paper describing lessons learned, best practices, and valuable techniques

[](http://msdn.microsoft.com/asp.net/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnaspp/html/upgradingaspnet.asp)that will help developers upgrade their applications.

If you have existing ASP.NET applications that you will eventually upgrade to

2.0, you may want to look at some of this information sooner rather than later,

since it may affect some work you do today.
