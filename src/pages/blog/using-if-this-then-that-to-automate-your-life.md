I’ve just started getting into [If This Then That (ifttt.com)](http://ifttt.com) and have set up a simple task that will update my [Steve Smith Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/StevenAndrewSmith) whenever I post something here to my blog.  Getting this set up was extremely simple to do, and so far although I’ve only been using it for about an hour I’m quite impressed and enamored with ifttt.com.  Here’s how easy it is to set up something like this:

**1\. Register with ifttt.com**

This took 30 seconds.

**2\. Create a task**

If **_this_** (the trigger):

**_Then_** (the action to take – create a new Link Post on my Facebook Page):

End Result:

This is actually the first post I’m making since adding this task, so if this post shows up on [my Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/StevenAndrewSmith) then it worked.

## Recipes

You don’t have to reinvent every wheel with If-This-Then-That.  They support the notion of _[recipes](http://ifttt.com/recipes)_, which are basically combinations of triggers and tasks that others have found useful and shared.  For instance, right now the most popular recipe is one that will automatically save to a folder in DropBox every photo that someone tags you in on Facebook.  Another popular one will automatically email you if the weather forecast calls for rain tomorrow (perhaps to say, “Don’t forget your umbrella!”).  There are over five thousand recipes available so far, so it’s a good place to browse for ideas for how you might use If-This-Then-That to automate some of your life.

Do you have a favorite recipe or use for If-This-Then-That?  Please let me know in the comments below.
