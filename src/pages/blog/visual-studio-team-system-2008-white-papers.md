Microsoft has published a set of white papers which provide a good technical overview of the features available in Visual Studio Team System 2008. They’re available individually for download: [Visual Studio Team System 2008 Capabilities White Papers](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=3605F904-7266-4426-8B92-44105AFF9762&displaylang=en).

The papers cover the following subjects, corresponding to features sets and design goals of VSTS 2008:

* Communicate and Collaborate
* Drive Predictability
* Ensure Quality Early and Often
* Integrate Work Frequently
* Making Real-Time Decisions
* Managing Team Workflow
* Using Familiar Tools

I wrote the Integrate Work Frequently paper, which describes some of the new build system features, including the capability to implement [Continuous Integration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_Integration) easily. We’ve been using Team System since its 2005 introduction at Lake Quincy Media, and I’ve been a longtime fan of continuous integration, as well. I was very glad to see its inclusion in VSTS 2008, and I’m sure it will be a big help to a lot of software shops.
