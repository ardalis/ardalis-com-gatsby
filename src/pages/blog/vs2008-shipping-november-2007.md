It’s official now – [Microsoft has announced that it will ship Visual Studio 2008 and the .NET Framework 3.5 later his month, November 2007](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2007/nov07/11-05TechEdDevelopersPR.mspx). The announcement came earlier today at TechEd Developers in Barcelona, Spain. I expect a similar announcement will be made this week during the keynotes for [DevConnections](http://aspadvice.com/blogs/devconnections). You can read the whole announcement [here](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2007/nov07/11-05TechEdDevelopersPR.mspx) (although it’s just a more longwinded and marketingish way of saying what I just said).
