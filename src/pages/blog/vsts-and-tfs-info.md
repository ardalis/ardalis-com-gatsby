I’m working on installing TFS Beta 3 Refresh and have been told by [Cindy](http://brucato.us/BLOGS/cindy) that these links are all helpful:

* [Installation Guide](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=E54BF6FF-026B-43A4-ADE4-A690388F310E&displaylang=en)
* [WSS Service Pack 2](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/techinfo/sharepoint/wss.mspx)

I’m hoping my version of SQL Server 2005 will work, since it’s not quite the build number it says it wants – more on that later.
