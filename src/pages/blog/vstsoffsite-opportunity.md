Ok, so I just finished a 3-day Ascend class on VSTS and one thing I’m

disappointed by is the fact that I most likely won’t be able to use VSTS to

replace [SourceGear Vault](http://sourcegear.com/vault/index.html)

[](http://sourcegear.com/vault/index.html)immediately, since I collaborate with developers over the Internet all over

the world, and VSTS does a lot of stuff via AD or direct network access.

The only solution for over-the-internet work is a VPN, which at the moment I

don’t have, though I guess I should probably start looking into what’s involved

with that.

However, this sounds a lot like the issues involved with Visual SourceSafe

that led to [SourceGear’s](http://sourcegear.com/)first big product,

[SourceOffSite](http://sourcegear.com/sos/index.html). Wouldn’t

it be cool if some enterprising company (like, maybe, [SourceGear](http://sourcegear.com/)) were to offer an add-on to VSTS

that allowed it to work over the Internet without requiring any VPN? I

know I’d be very interested in that.
