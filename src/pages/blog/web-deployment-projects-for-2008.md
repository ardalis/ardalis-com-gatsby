[](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/default.aspx "VSTS_Logo")Web Deployment Projects (WDP) for Visual Studio 2008 were released to the web (RTW) a couple of days ago. These didn’t make the November ship date of VS2008, but were promised to follow shortly after release, and as promised, they’re here! I haven’t looked at the 2008 version yet – personally I use [PyroBatchFTP](http://www.emtec.com/pyrobatchftp/index.html) + [CC.NET](http://confluence.public.thoughtworks.org/display/CCNET/Welcome+to+CruiseControl.NET) + MSBuild to do my deployments – but I may have a look and reconsider my approach. One thing that would be nice is the configuration merge capabilities offered by WDP.
