Yesterday, Microsoft [released a CTP for Web Deployment Projects for Visual Studio 2008](http://blogs.msdn.com/webdevtools/archive/2007/12/01/web-deployment-projects-wdp-for-visual-studio-2008-december-2007-ctp-released.aspx). I don’t use these in my own projects, having built a robust system that revolves around CruiseControl.NET and PyroBatchFTP, but it sounds like they have fixed some of the pain points with the new release, which has these new features:

* Full migration support from WDP for VS 2005
* WDP output is replaced only if the WDP build succeeds
* IIS7 Support

There is a fairly [extensive walkthrough with the announcement here](http://blogs.msdn.com/webdevtools/archive/2007/12/01/web-deployment-projects-wdp-for-visual-studio-2008-december-2007-ctp-released.aspx).
