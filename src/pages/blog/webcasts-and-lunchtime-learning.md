[Cindy Brucato](http://brucato.us/blogs/cindy) has begun an

interesting lunchtime learning program at her workplace, which she’s dubbed [The Brown Bag](http://brucato.us/BLOGS/cindy/archive/2005/06/21/552.aspx)

[Initiative (or Brown Bagging It) — BBI](http://brucato.us/BLOGS/cindy/archive/2005/06/21/552.aspx). Yesterday she updated this

with [a list](http://brucato.us/BLOGS/cindy/archive/2005/06/22/553.aspx)

[of good webcasts to watch](http://brucato.us/BLOGS/cindy/archive/2005/06/22/553.aspx)during these events, and since most of them looked

interesting to me, I’m blogging it so I can find the links

later.
