[Nikhil](http://www.nikhilk.net/) has updated his [WebDevHelper](http://www.nikhilk.net/WebDevHelperHTTPTracingUpdates.aspx) utility to include direct support for Atlas. His original WebDevHelper is a nice plug-in for the browser that provides a lot of similar functionality to the [FireFox development toolbar](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/60) combined with the [Fiddler](http://www.fiddlertool.com/) utility. His new update includes some nice parsing features that make it much easier to see what is being passed on the wire for MSAJAX UpdatePanels and similar controls. Check it out.
