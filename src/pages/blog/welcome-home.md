Just wanted to say “Welcome Home” a bit late to all of the Vietnam Vets out there, after reading [Bob Parsons’ post on the subject](http://www.bobparsons.com/Welcomehome.html). My uncle served in Vietnam and has never been much interested in talking about it, though my own Iraq experience has led us to discuss things a bit recently. All I can say is, thanks to everyone who went, and though I wasn’t around at the time, I apologize for all of the ungrateful idiots who treated you (and likely continue to treat you) so poorly.

One of [Bob’s commenters](http://www.bobparsons.com/Welcomehome.html) suggested [this book, “Unheralded Victory”](http://www.amazon.com/Unheralded-Victory-Defeat-Vietnamese-1961-1973/dp/0891418660/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/103-3214816-1975838?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1179687485&sr=8-1), which I’ll have to check out. It sounds interesting, if nothing else (no, I haven’t read it yet, so I can’t comment further).
