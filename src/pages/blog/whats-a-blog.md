If you’re asking this question, or wondering what B-L-O-G could possibly stand for, you’re not alone. *Blog* was the #1 most looked up word in 2004 according to Merriam Webster. Read more about it in [this article](http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/internet/11/30/words.of.the.year.reut/index.html), which also lists the other members of the top 10 most looked up words for the year.

“Blog” is a concatenation, not an acronym. It’s short for “web log” and according to Webster’s current definition, is “a Web site that contains an online personal journal with reflections, comments, and often hyperlinks.”
