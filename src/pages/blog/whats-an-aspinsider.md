Some of you have heard of a new group, the [ASPInsiders](http://aspinsiders.com/). Lately, I’ve been getting a lot of questions about this group such as who are they, are they a replacement for (insert another group here), how do I get in, etc. Thankfully, the group has created an FAQ to answer these exact questions. You can find the answers to these questions and more [here](http://aspinsiders.mykb.com/).
