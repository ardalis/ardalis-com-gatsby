The new VS 2010 has a new lineup of versions which you can find described on the [Visual Studio 2010 Products page](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010/default.mspx#compare). Some things to note:

* *Ultimate*is the new*Suite*
* The “Data Dude” SKU is now fully incorporated in the Premium and Ultimate versions
* Premium and Ultimate come with a production license for Expression Studio 3, as well as Visio and Project 2010.
* All versions now come with some Windows Azure pieces for dev/test use
* All versions ship with Team Foundation Server (which now [supports running on the client as a lightweight alternative to a full server-side install](http://blogs.msdn.com/bharry/archive/2009/10/01/tfs-2010-for-sourcesafe-users.aspx)), providing version control, build automation, bug tracking, and continuous automation out of the box very quickly
