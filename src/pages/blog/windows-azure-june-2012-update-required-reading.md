These announcements are still being made live at [MeetWindowsAzure.com](http://meetwindowsazure.com/), and I haven’t had a chance to review all of these links yet myself, but this should provide you with the info you need to really understand what this might mean for your organization or as a developer targeting Windows Azure.
