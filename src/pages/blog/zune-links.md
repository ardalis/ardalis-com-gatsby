\[categories: zune] I’ve accumulated some links, mostly for video encoding stuff, for the Zune that I’d like to share here.

[PQDVD](http://www.pqdvd.com/dvd-to-zune-video-converter.html)– commercial software for DVD ripping. Also will do DivX and other format converting, but I haven’t used that feature because I didn’t know about it and I only bought the DVD converter. They offer video and DVD for $39.95, and based on my experience with the DVD tool that would be worth it (to me, anyway) unless some of the free stuff below works nearly as well (which I haven’t determined yet).

[SUPER](http://www.erightsoft.net/SUPER.html)– Free video encoding and DVD ripping. Haven’t used it yet but I’ve downloaded it and it was recommended to me.\
[Encode360](http://dcunningham.net/encode360)– Designed to convert things into WMVs for use on the XBox 360 or the Zune.

**Releated Links:**\
[Windows Media Player 11](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/player/download/default.aspx)\
[Windows Media Encoder 9](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/forpros/encoder/default.mspx)\
[K-Lite Full Code Pack](http://www.free-codecs.com/K_Lite_Codec_Pack_download.htm)
