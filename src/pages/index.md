        assessment from Steve. An assessment will reveal “low hanging fruit”

        security and performance issues as well as maintainability anti-patterns
        and technical debt. [Read

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
