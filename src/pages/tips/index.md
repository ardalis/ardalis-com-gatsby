  Weekly Dev Tips – The Podcast
  Listen to my Weekly Dev Tips podcast for more software development tips, provided in short audio form. You can expect some overlap in terms of topics, but unless you’ve been getting the newsletter since day one, you probably won’t find too much repetition between the two formats. Available online, iTunes, etc.
