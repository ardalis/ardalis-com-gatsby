# **Chocolatey**

# **Code Editor**

I mainly work in Visual Studio Enterprise 2017, but I also regularly use Visual Studio Code.

    "editor.wordWrap": "on",
    "window.zoomLevel": 1,
    "workbench.colorTheme": "Default Light+",
    "editor.formatOnSave": true
}
```

# **Source Control**

I’m a huge fan of Git and [GitHub](https://github.com/ardalis). I’m currently using [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) or the git command line for client-side git operations. I’m using VisualStudio.com with git for some client projects, too. My biggest complaint about using VisualStudio.com vs. GitHub is the authentication story, as I’ve had no end of problems with using Microsoft accounts to connect to VSTS.

# **Screencasting**

I record online courses for [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/steve-smith) and [DevIQ](https://deviq.com/me/steve-smith/) and occasional screencasts on YouTube. I use [TechSmith Camtasia](https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html) to record and produce my screencasts and [TechSmith SnagIt](https://www.techsmith.com/screen-capture.html) for screenshots. I also use [LiceCAP](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) for animated screen captures, which are useful for tweets and [emailed tips](/tips).

# **Streaming**

I’m currently streaming on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/ardalis) most Fridays, discussing developer topics. I may stream gaming at some point but I’d want that on a separate channel. The streams are archived on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/ardalis). My setup uses [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/). There’s enough complexity there that I’ll probably create a separate article just for the rest of the details, including how I’ve configured an [Elgato Stream Deck](https://amzn.to/2G7JtWy).

# **Laptop**

In December 2019 I finally broke down and bought a new laptop. It’s a 15″ Dell XPS with 1TB of storage and 32GB of RAM. I’ll post an unboxing article with some more details and link to it from here. So far it has no stickers, but I expect that will change soon. The MBP (below) is still going strong but will mainly stay at home now. Its MacOS calendar printing capabilities are worth keeping it around, if nothing else (we use many different Google calendars to manage our family of 6 and nothing else we’ve found can print out decent looking weekly/monthly calendars).

I’m writing this on a Macbook Pro Retina 15″ circa 2013 (I purchased it in June 2014). It’s running 2.3 GHz Intel Core i7 and has 16GB 1600 MHz DDR3 RAM and an Intel Iris Pro 1536 MB graphics card. It’s still running well. I run Parallels to run Windows on it and I switch back and forth between MacOS and Windows when developing. It’s accumulated a few stickers over the years – here’s a pic from September 2018:

# **Desktop**

I recently built a new Ultimate Developer Rig, [which I wrote about with benchmarks here](https://ardalis.com/ultimate-developer-rig-2019). You can view just the parts [here](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/Ffjm9J). Here’s a short summary:

* Core i9-9900K 3.6GHz 8-Core Processor
* Gigabyte Z390 AORUS MASTER ATX LGA1151 Motherboard
* 32 GB DDR4-3866 Memory
* 1TB M.2 SSD
* GeForce RTX 2080 8 GB Video Card

It’s a beast I named NightKing.

# **Avatar**

![](/img/steve-smith-ardalis-200x200.jpg)

Custom avatar by Nate Lovett

My avatar was created by [Nate Lovett](https://twitter.com/natelovett). I’m on the [Stir Trek](https://stirtrek.com) conference board and in 2016 we had Nate produce avatars for all of our speakers and board members. He did a great job, and if you’d like him to create one for you, contact him via twitter. I’m currently using this avatar on most of my social media and Slack channels, as well as the basis for my [Weekly Dev Tips podcast](http://weeklydevtips.com) logo.

[David Neal (@reverentgeek)](https://twitter.com/reverentgeek) also does some great custom-drawn avatars.

# **Drawing**

Speaking of David Neal, he turned me on to the great [Sketches Pro app for iOS](http://tayasui.com/sketches/). I’m using that along with an Apple Pencil and a relatively new iPad to create drawings for my blog posts, newsletters, and presentations. My drawing abilities are still pretty weak, but the app is very powerful and it’s quite pleasant to use the combination. In the past, I’d tried drawing pads for the PC, but it’s much easier to draw directly on the (portable) surface you’re working with than to draw on the desk while looking at the screen, I found.

# **Podcast**

My podcast, [Weekly Dev Tips](http://www.weeklydevtips.com/), is hosted by [Simplecast](https://simplecast.com/). I use a [Rode Podcaster microphone](http://amzn.to/2p2FjpD) to record, with [PSM 1 Shockmount](http://amzn.to/2FmLcsI) and [PSA1 Swivel Boom Arm](http://amzn.to/2oWtC4M). I use [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/) for both recording and editing. I try to script the shows as markdown which I edit using Visual Studio Code and then upload to Simplecast to act as the show notes. You can see [my podcasting checklist here](https://ardalis.com/weeklydevtips-podcast-checklist).

# **XBox**

I recently started to make some time to play PUBG on the XBox One (my gamerID is ‘ardalis’ of course). The game’s a lot more fun with friends, which requires an adapter and headset/microphone. Here’s what I’m using:

* [Turtle Beach Headset Audio Controller Plus](https://amzn.to/2P6ahca) (my original XBox One controllers lack a headphone jack)
* [BENGOO G9000 Stereo Gaming Headset, noise cancelling over ear headphones](http://amzn.to/2Dlxfp2)

# **Summary**
